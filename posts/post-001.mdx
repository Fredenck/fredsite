description: How this came to be
---

I was always interested in my life's notable events, 'canon' events per se. 
I first used Instagram to loosely keep track of such events; however, I didn't care if my followers saw them.

I like pictures, especially the good ones. 
My recent trip in Europe contains so many memories and pictures that I want to record.
Another aspect is to share my thoughts, to write. 
Egoist or not, I believe my thinking is unique and possibly the best. 
I previously jotted down my thoughts on my phone's Notes app, but they became a little too long and disorganized. 
Thus, I'll slowly transition them to here!

Functionality-wise, I was inspired by [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/) and my classmate [Michael Lan](https://mzchael.com/).

I used Next.js 13's App Router system along with TailwindCSS for styling. 
For middleware, contentlayer proved to be super helpful in rendering and parsing metadata from my mdx posts.

A nasty problem I was caught in was **dependency hell**. I spent about hours learning Nextjs, setting up the website, and resolving dependency/build bugs through 50 bajillion online resources.
I was even considering switching to Astro but ultimately resolved my problems through downgrading contentlayer to 0.3.1 and adding overrides for @opentelemetry as seen by a 
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/506#issuecomment-1625210487) created literally a week ago.

Currently, the blog seems to be working, which is wonderful :).

I do plan to add a few professional features such as a resume and project portfolio tab, but those should be theoretically simple and just a link to other sites.
