I always thought to myself if I were to have a Wikipedia page, what would be on it?
I first used Instagram to loosely keep track of such events but it's not built for writing (caption word limit)
and I didn't always have corresponding pictures.
I also felt self-conscious which is a bit contradictory to what this site is
but I think there is a difference.

Words are powerful. They create connections.
[Justin Jackson](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html) describes it really well.

I wanted somewhere to share my thoughts, to write.
I change a lot, yet I don't really change.
Around high school, I would look back at Fred from a year ago and be in awe at how much I changed.
Every year, every day, every second I change;
for the better and the worse, but on average for the better.

Meeting new people and experiencing new things drive change.
Documenting my thoughts as I live life is a perfect way to encode this information. 

I also considered vlogging. It'd be a great way to gather all my pictures but harder to express all of my feelings.
Plus, I believe blogging is easier to maintain!
I used to jot some thoughts on the Notes app but they became too long and disorganized hence the transition to this.

Functional inpsiration from [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/) and [Michael Lan](https://mzchael.com/).
They have a really nice lightweight site with Next, which is why I chose Next as well.
There doesn't have to be fancy flares and transitions for a simple blog because words are powerful.

I used Next.js 13's App Router system along with TailwindCSS for styling. 
For middleware, contentlayer proved to be super helpful in rendering and parsing metadata from my mdx posts.
It's still in beta so working with it has been kind of a pain but a valuable experience nonetheless.

A nasty problem I was caught in was **dependency hell**.
I spent about hours learning Nextjs, setting up the website, 
and resolving dependency/build bugs through 50 bajillion online resources.
I was even considering switching to Astro but ultimately resolved my problems through downgrading contentlayer to 0.3.1 and adding overrides for @opentelemetry as seen by a 
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/506#issuecomment-1625210487) created literally a week ago (as of writing).

Currently, the blog seems to be working, which is wonderful :).
