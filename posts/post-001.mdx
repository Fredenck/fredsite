description: How this came to be

I was always interested in big events of my life, 'canon' events per say. 
I first used Instagram to keep track, vaguely, of such events; however, the caption word limit and image limit of 10 bugged me.

I like pictures, especially good ones. I like to share them. Traveling abroad in Europe recently left me with so many pictures and stories that I want to share.
Another aspect is to just share my thoughts. Egoist or not, I believe my thoughts are one-of-a-kind, great, and are words of wisdom. 
I previously jotted down my thoughts on my phone's Notes app but they became a little long and disorganized. Thus, I'll slowly transition them to here!

Functionality-wise, I was inspired by [Rob Lee](https://leerob.io/) and my classmate [Michael Lan](https://mzchael.com/).

I used Next.js 13's App Router system along with TailwindCSS for styling. 
For middleware, contentlayer proved to be super helpful to render and parse metadata from my mdx posts.
<br></br>
A nasty problem I was caught in was **dependency hell**. I spent about 25 hours learning Nextjs, setting up the website, and resolving dependency and build bugs through 50 bajillion online resources.
I was even considering switching to Astro but ultimately resolved my problems through downgrading contentlayer to 0.3.1 and adding overrides for @opentelemetry as seen by a 
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/506#issuecomment-1625210487) created literally a week ago.

As of now the blog seems to be working, which is wonderful :).

I do plan to add a few professional features such as a resume and project portfolio tab, but those should be theoretically simple and just link to other sitess
