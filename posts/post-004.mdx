description: How my preference in literature changed
---

As a kid, I was a reader. Some of my favorites include Percy Jackson (specifically most of Rick Riordan's books), Eragon, Ranger's Apprentice, Warriors, and Wings of Fire.
Some comics I adored included Bones, Amulet, Garfield, and Big Nate.

I would spend hours in the library, strolling down the aisles scanning the bookshelves for books that piqued my interest. That was always a struggle.
I even tried to read during class in 6th grade. That didn't work out so well.
In middle school, my parents dropped me off at the library over the summer because they didn't want me at home during the day.
Out of all the ones I've been to, the Milpitas Library was outstanding and the one I frequented the most. Particularly, the tall ceilings made it seem like another world to me; it's hard to describe.

I think it was around 6th grade that my friend from Idaho introduced me to this thing called "Naruto". 
I distinctly remember watching it and even tearing up within the first few episodes. I would stay up late and watch it on my bed.
It was my first anime before even knowing what anime was.

From then on, I delved into the world of anime. This would later turn into manga and webtoons. 
I'll likely create a separate post for anime just because of it's impact on me.

In school, I would read most of the required literature; I can't say I read all of them. They were always a little depressing and too heavy for my tastes.
The summer after graduating, I dropped by the Milpitas Library again, for good times sake. I relished in the nostalgia and reminisced about my time there.
Time truly goes by in the blink of an eye. The library was the same...but different.

Fast forward to the summer of my freshman year in college, June 2023. While studying abroad in London, my friend brought me to a book store: Daunt Books.
I was taking in the scenery, once again walking past books that didn't interest me. That was until I walked downstairs where I saw *Heaven* by Mieko Kawakami. As an avid fan of Japanese culture, I was drawn to the book cover of two Japanese students with a mysterious expression and the book cover's color palette: a muted yellow.

I read this book on the Eurostar from London to Paris, and it was good. The book was about an adolescent friendship built upon suffering and explored concepts of morality and Nietzsche philosophy. I highly recommend. In Paris, I tried to find *Breasts and Eggs*, another book of Kawakami, but to no avail.
I ended up buying *No Longer Human* by Osamu Dazai, another book I had heard about. 
The book is quite depressing but an interesting read nonetheless. I never thought I would have the attention span to read books again after having access to a convenient array of anime, manga, manhwa, light novels, and so much more.

I hope to continue reading on the side.
