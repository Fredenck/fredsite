I loved books as a kid. It was amazing how there existed another world within the pages.
My avid imagination enabled me to exist within those worlds. I loved reading.

I remember aimlessly strolling down the aisles in the library,
picking out interesting covers or titles.
In fact, I did this so much that it was a struggle to find my next book.

In elementary school, I often spaced out or tried to read in class. Class just wasn't interesting.
After getting in trouble a few times, I stopped.

Some of my favorites include most Rick Riordan books (especially *Percy Jackson*),
*Eragon*, *Ranger's Apprentice*, *Amulet of Samarkand*, *Dragon's Pupils - The Sword Guest*,
*Five Ancestors*, *The Time Machine*, *Warriors*, and so much more.
I also liked reading comics; however, they often didn't have enough content: *Bones*,
*Amulet* and *Garfield*.

In middle school, my parents dropped me off at the library over the summer because they didn't want me at home all day.
There, I would do some work and read in between.
My favorite and most frequented library was the Milpitas Library.
It's pretty modern: the combination of tall glass windows, ceilings, and air conditioning made it magical.

I slowly stopped reading as much in middle school.
I would read most of the required literature in school but I can't say I read all of them.
They were always a little depressing and too heavy for my tastes; I never really liked Dystopian novels.

By high school, I stopped reading; I spent a lot of time watching anime (see next post).

I took AP Lit in senior year.
Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the literature we covered.
Maybe I was older, but the books were memorable and meaningful in contrast to
previous literature in high school.
However, the class was rushed; we'd typically read *Invisible Man* the summer prior
but didn't due to COVID.
Instead, we spent the first two months or so going through the novel.
That really pushed back the schedule and we ended up cramming all the other literature.
Overloaded with information, I couldn't appeciate each book.
Despite that, I'm thankful we got through all of the books because they're valuable
and I don't think I would have read them on my own. 

The summer after graduating, I dropped by the Milpitas Library again, for good times sake.
I relished in the nostalgia and reminisced about my time there.
Time truly goes by in the blink of an eye. Exciting days became memories. The library was the same...but different.

Summer after freshman year in college, I was studying abroad in London.
There, a friend brought me to Daunt Books, a book store.
By that time, it had been ages since I read a book on my own accord.

It was really nice inside.
The ambient lighting from the glass ceiling along with books filling the shelves to the brim
created a wonderful atmosphere.

Wanting to read again, the muted yellow cover of *Heaven* caught my attention.
The story follows an adolescent friendship built upon suffering; it had been ages since I was interested in a book.
Rather short, I finished it on the Eurostar from London to Paris.

In Paris, I tried to find *Breasts and Eggs*, another book of the author, Kawakami, but to no avail.
In the end, I picked up *No Longer Human* by Osamu Dazai.

I never thought I would have the attention span to read books again
after having access to the vast and convenient array of anime, manga, manhwa, light novels,
and so much more but it was refreshing to connect with my younger self.

I hope to continue reading.
