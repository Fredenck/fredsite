## Prologue
I've been busy. Kind of. Right after Spring quarter ended, I left for home, stayed for 1.5 days, then left to Seattle for my internship. When I go back I'll be home for a few days, then fly out to Asia to visit my grandparents and travel.

A bit of deja vu: last year I studied abroad and had to leave right after finals as well; I didn't have time to catch my breath.

### Spring Break
Let's get Spring Break out of the way.

After starting college, I've come to appreciate coming home. I get to see my dog!! I get my own room, bigger than the one I share with two others at school; I get to live the quiet little life. See more [here](./post-015)

Whenever I come back, I always meet up with my closest high school friends. This time was no different. We got lunch at Sala Thai, then wandered around the newly constructed area near central Fremont. Meandering around, we found a random bookstore and pointed at all the books we used to read. It's always fun talking to them. I get to see how we've all changed; time moves fast.

I've also been making an effort to host more often. It's nice because it forces you to tidy up the house--something that we typically don't do. Over break, we tried making some kind of dessert. We ran into all sorts of issues. The cream cheese wasn't thawed so we tried a water bath. That took too long so we settled on bashing it up with the electric whisks. It more or less worked out. After all that effort, we added the eggs. We cracked it over the bowl but green goo came out instead. The egg was rotten. Since it had gotten in the mixing bowl, we just threw everything out. It was funny and fun though. I remember we baked cookies last year, and I hope to continue doing this little tradition.

Having access to a car and the freedom of no assignments hits different. I get to laze around in bed, doom scrolling until I'm sick of it. As part of an effort to go out and do more things, I decided to check out a cafe I had saved on my phone for a while and do some work for whatCoffee, a local bakery/cafe I'm making a website for. Unfortunately it was late morning and the cafe was full. I ended up ordering a drink anyway, and went to a nearby park to work. Unfortunatelyx2, it was sunny with no shade, and construction was going on right beside me. I finally opted to go to a nearby library after finishing my drink. Libraries are nice. I love the idea of public government-maintained facilities, but do wish some were maintained a bit more.

Finally, I also got to do my first legitimate bike trail. A college friend and I both biked and always talked about biking together. After some research, I decided on Old la Honda trail: a 19-mile 2600 feet "benchmark" climb. The ETA is 2.5 hours, but we took 4.5 hours...

Biking uphill is hard. Every half of a mile I had to stop, sometimes even walking up the steeper portions. I had puddles of sweat in my shoes. Downhill was rough as well. Since we took so long uphill, the sun started to set as we headed down. I wasn't wearing a jacket so my hands were frozen. On the way down, I was just trying to survive. I tried to minimize braking because it'd slow me down and the action of adding pressure to my hands to brake hurt. I wasn't even singing to my music; I started shouting, pushing my adrenaline to keep me warm. One of my legs would cramp if I stopped moving it.

We eventually made it though. Despite miserable, it's something that I "enjoyed"; someday in the future, I'll actually train and try to do it again.

## An Appreciation for My Campus
This year, I've spent a bit more time on campus during the day. I like walking around, exploring the crevices of campus. It's always super interesting seeing how each building connects with each other, but also stressful when I'm lost and late for class. 

I've also come to enjoy South Campus' sculptures and gardens. I picked up running to imrpove my endurance and cardiovascular health. This came from wanting to exercise, but not wanting to be sore for tennis the next day. Anyways, running brought back a lot of nostalgia from when I used to run and bike while listening to chinese music during COVID. It's still a little scary running at night: will the sculptures in the sculpture garden come to life and chase after me? Will there be haunted forgotten children at the child care center? Nonetheless, it's peaceful being out there by myself. It's a nice way to have time for myself. You get to breathe in the fresh air, clear your mind, and enjoy the scenery--flowers, pavement, and brick.  

I strongly believe that the most beautiful days are the ones after it rains. Maybe the rain clears up the sky, but the sky seems so much bluer, and the grass greener. It's nice walking around campus, especially near Powell and Royce down the Janss steps. I also love seeing all the people who gather on the Janss lawn on nice days; it really makes college feel like college.

Near the end of the year, I saw tons of people taking grad photos. That's going to be me soon; I hope to make my college experience one to be proud of.

## A Roadblock
Last year, I was in Foundatinos during Winter Quarter. I had lots of fun, but also wanted to try several different things, which I did this year. I've been itching to dance and know that I'm at the stage where I can exponentially get better.

I didn't get in. I forgot that the form wanted COVID cards, so I had to scramble to upload it from my phone to my computer as all of my repsonses were already on the computer. I dedicated a long and genuine response if you were interested:
> I joined last year with no experience and just a desire to be more comfortable with my body. I’ve definitely gotten more comfortable, but I think I need the extra step from foundations. I always see really nice choreos on instagram or youtube, and sometimes I try to learn them. Unfortunately, I don’t have enough experience in the foundational movements so it takes forever to even get a single 8 count. Plus, something always looks off. With foundations, I’ll be able to learn through the directors and experienced dancers. I feel like I’ve just gotten over the initial hump and can really grow right now; foundations would be perfect and a nice platform for joining a more competitive team. 

I submitted the form 6 minutes after it was released, but that was too late. I know that it's mostly time-based and seniors are prioritized, but I was still really dissapointed. I also saw they had a "training" team which did not perform but only did weekly choreo trainings. I applied for that as well and didn't even get that. I was really dissapointed at this point. 

Out of all the things I do, dance is something I've decided I want to pursue. The plan was to do Foundations in the spring, possible take some classes over the summer, then go for a competitive team in the Fall. If that didn't work out, I would do Foundatinos again, maybe even captaining, and go for mid-year competitive auditions. I also considered K-cover groups such as KBM/Seoula/Koreos. Now that spring is a no-go, summer is stalled. At this point, I'm not good enough for a competitve team and I still want to experience one more quarter of Dragon Boat. That meant waiting until winter. That's two entire years without being on a team. Time is rough man. 

I think the current plan is to a bit of dance over the summer, Dragon Boat in the fall, then try out for VSU Modern mid-years and Foundations if I don't get in. Then go for a comp/cover team senior year. Things are getting tense, I'm getting old; I can't let this get away.

## Tennis
When one door closes, another opens. Spring quarter was originally a time for dance, and potentially tennis on the side. Without dance, I had more time which diverted to tennis. 

I first touched a racket in middle school but that very quickly turned sour. I have terrible hand-eye coordination. I was always doing water sports and sat down at my computer for way too long.

I starting putting in more time towards tennis this quarter: I asked for tips and to hit frequently. I've grown to enjoy hitting sessions, even when there's no small talk. There's something about hitting back and forth for hours. You get to hone in and focus on the minute details.

Contrary to last quarter, I've grown critical on technique and playtime; I found myself preferring hitting with someone over club tennis: you get more court time and have to work on positioning, a core aspect of tennis. I chased the tennis fervor.

At times, it was rough. When someone watched, I would get nervous and perform suboptimally. I remember hitting with some friends and another skilled friend who was passing by jokingly said "This is a good group to hit with, how'd you sneak your way into it?" Frankly, it hurt. First and foremost the group consisted of friends, rather than hitting partners. Second, it felt as though I wasn't qualified to be there.

I needed more practice. My roomate was always down to hit, but my obsession grew beyond that. I asked others to fill in the gap. Sadly, there weren't many of similar or slightly higher skill who had the time to hit. This was even more so for the more skilled; very few people would spend time giving me tips. I did find people, though; those sessions helped a lot.

## Muay Thai
Trying to keep myself busy without dance, I took a Muay Thai class. In comparison to a club, it's more instructive and straightforward. There weren't many interactions between everyone in the class, but we did have partners. It was nice talking to mine, and we ended up following each other on instagram.

The class was taught quite well. It's impossible to teach Muay Thai well in such of a short time: 8-10 1 hour sessions every week. Despite the challenge, the coach emphasized the core aspects and ended branching out a bit to the flashier moves. He catered well towards learning the crux of the martial art while keeping it interesting for those who will likely not pursue such a thing.

## Fencing
When I finished Winter Quarter, I'd resolved to quit fencing after trying out a tournament.  It's a pity because I do like some of the people and started making more improvements with more time on the strip. I've started to appreciate the sport.

We had an exchange event where UCI's team came over. They were much more of a team compared to us. They did partner warm ups, talked to each other, and had fun. In contrast, our team was silent, sitting against the wall. I got to see how they fenced; it was intense and they had fun.  I was surprised and a little angry. It felt like I had wasted two quarters; I wasn't fencing, I was "fencing".

Fast forward to my first tournament: the Okawa Open. It was my first time suiting up, which was exciting. 

There are two rounds: Seeding and Direct Elimination. First, you are split into pods/groups. Within the pod, you fence each person and accumulate a final ranking. These are bouts to 5. During Direct Elimination, you face the n - i seeded rank, where n is the total number of fencers and i is your rank. That means the top fencer faces the bottom. These are longer bouts to 15.

As we started the Seeding round, the ref asked for approved gear to which I had to go and get approval for. Then, I was rejected, because the glove was to standard. The fencing had already begun and I had to get new gear. I ran up to the club room and switched out my glove. I was out of it; my tempo was messed up.

Looking back, I definitely could have won the first bout. I don't think I warmed up properly and was still rattled because I thought I'd be DQ'd/forfeit my bouts. That bout ended in 4-5. My weapon, the strength I capitilize on, is my long and powerful lunge. However, because I was rattled, I defaulted to the same exact attack every round: striking the head (position 5).

I lost most of my other matches, doing so-so. The one I did win was probably due to a equipment malfunction: my mask cord kept disconnecting during the match. There were one or two double-touch points which could have very well been his, assuming my mask cord was disconnected.

The referee, a high schooler, was kind, and helped explain how all of this worked. It felt like he was rooting for me, which was nice. One of my friends also showed up and helped film (for review/memories). I appreciate it. He also encouraged me to ask for tips from a fencer I got demolished against, 0-5. It's something I wasn't planning on doing so I initially declined. After thinking a bit more, I ended up seeking guidance from her.

During Elimination, I was against someone from UCLA. Because we didn't have enough participants, Men's and Women's Sabre were combined. I had experience fencing her; I knew her habits and style and countered them: sometimes going for a powerful straight attack, and other times going for a parry riposte or feint.

I did feel bad. She was kind and helped me buy knee-high socks before the tournament. However, I tend to separate personal and professional business. It's an insult to the sport and her, if I'm not playing to win. At least, that's the overarching philosophy I hold.

My next bout was with a well-known, skilled high schooler. The final score was something like 2-15, which is an accomplishment because these were legitimate points against a skilled fencer. I almost scored a third: he began with an attack on prep, to which I faked a counterattack. I abruptly stopped, avoiding his attack and gaining priority. My next move should have been to strike, as I had right of way. I guess I thought he hit me, so I looked at the clock, losing my right of way. Even the head ref was mad at the failed conclusion of a well-played point, hahaha.

My journey with fencing wasn't that bad. I ended with my first tournament, which started out rough but ganied traction. I'm satisfied, knowing I got to perform to the best of my abilities, at least for the Direct Elimination rounds. I even got to finish off by facing an extremely skilled fencer; I got to throw everything I had at the wall of experience he had built.

Before quitting, I asked a few people what fencing meant to them and why they liked it. I was trying to gauge what I wanted out of fencing. Ultimately, I concluded that UCLA Fencing had a lack of club support. I didn't even know how tournaments were structured until the tournament already began and still don't quite understand how priority works. There was a lack of a role model; I was looking for someone who loved fencing and was good at it; someone I could be amazed when watching. It's a little difficult to find these kind of people in college fencing, because most fencers peaked and plateaued in high school. Many seemed burnt out/retired, and/or busy with school or other clubs.

My limiting factor was that I didn't know the standard strategies and have a clear sense of intent of the next action I'm going to take. I have the power and started developing a weapon: my powerful lunge. 

## A Good Club
What makes a good club? It's something I've thought a lot about and will save for a separate [post](./post-016). However, I do want to talk about Bruin Sports Analytics.

It's so nice having a team that cares. I remember getting a text about a bug past midnight and decided to get up and fix it. It took an hour, but I was rewarded with my troubles with the satisfaction. I've been with the code base since its creation. 390 commits, 172 PR/Issues. I know the project inside out. The project is something cool, amazing, and useful.

It's hard to come by clubs where people care. After all, most people are first and foremost students tring to earn a degree.

I'm quite the opposite. I taking the minimum number of classes, trying to understand the overall idea and am pretty much never stressed about my grades. I remember staying up 2 hours past my normal bedtime just to catch up on a webtoon; on the morning of my 8 am exam, I snoozed my alarm (I was conscious, but didn't care enough...), leading me to arrive late for my 8 am midterm. My grades have dropped a bit compared to freshman year, but it's still at a satisfiable level for me with my current level of effort. There's a saying that it takes 20% of the effort to achieve 80% of the work and 80% of the effort to achieve 20% of the work. I try to do 50% of the effort to achieve 90% of the work.

Anyways, long story short is that having a team that is passionate about the mission is hard to come by and should be treasured when found. I don't hold anything against people I've worked with who are not as proactive; I get it, it's only a club at the end of the day.

Regarding BSA, I'm also looking forward to how the club will grow next year.

As the project grows, the code is starting to become cluttered. Every line of code you write is a liability you have to maintain. This is something we need to work on the upcoming year. 

Additonally, we pump out results but the club is lacking in the club-sense. There is a disconnect between organizations in the entire club. We're trying to bridge that but it's hard because the work each org does is rather containerized. As an effort to be more social, we had a beach day at sunset canyon, played beach volleyball, mutated hot potato, and did a mini swim relay. It was a fun one-off event.

## Fun
I did a few interesting things this quarter.

I went to my first baseball game (Dodgers vs Giants). It's interesting how fast paced the sport is. I didn't even realize they started playing. I'm glad I got to see Freddy slide and secure a base and Ohtani + Betts' reliable hits. Also got a free jersey, which is pretty cool!

I went to my first Family Feud (Celebrity Edition) and got to see Steve Harvey, the Star Trek crew, the Deadliest Catch, and more.

I checked out UCLA's Jazz Combo showcase. I was originally going to go by myself, but a friend brought it up and invited me.
He never showed up though, haha. I still got to enjoy it and reminisce about the jazz I used to play.

I checked out my first Taiko showcase in support of a friend. I checked out a level test for the student instructor of my Muay Thai class. It's neat seeing these communities people dedicate towards.

As usual, I spent time with Tennis friends. We celebrated some birthdays, got good food, studied together at a cafe, and even watched the entirety of "Parasyte: The Grey" (like 6 1-hour episodes) in one evening.

Despite not getting in a dance team, I still enjoyed watching various showcases. I got to see K-Factor, and the Foundations showcase. Also attended various friends-and-families, as well as watch YouTube videos of performacnes like Prelude, VIBE, Battle Royale, and more. I hope to attend in person next year.

Also spent some time with my future housemates. First we got dinner just to so everyone knew each other's faces. We also played Valorant at the Riebar Gaming Lounge >:). Speaking of that, I've also played a lot of TFT with my roomate throughout the quarter (and year to be honest).

Finally, Spring also means my birthday! I graduated from being a teenager, and am now a 20-ager. I've never did anything big for my birthdays because they felt awkward; even as a kid, I felt out-of-place at my own birthday parties. Nonetheless, I always appreciate and enjoy birthday wishes and sometimes small tokens of appreciations from friends.

Last year, I was hanging around with Dragon Boat people at the IM fields because it was a nice day. My gym buddy also got me an ice cream sandwich, which was nice. This year was a bit more eventful. The night prior, someone brought it up at Club Tennis so I got some early birthday wishes; a little embarassing but not too bad. I'm trying to accept these things with more gracefulness. The day of, I was surprised by one of my clubs, who got Domino's pizza and lava cake, and wrote a small card to me and another club member (whose birthday was during the week). I invited my friends out to Honey Night as I had been craving their intestines for a while. Later, they surprised me with cake and catan as I was getting ready to sleep. I tend to follow a routine, so my roomate (a friend who helped organize it) thought I'd decline the catan; however, I've been making an effort to be more spontaneous. We ended playing and eating cake for a while. Things like this to break up the normal flow of life is always refreshing.
