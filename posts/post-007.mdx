# Prologue: Summer Prior

When I got in to UCLA, I was ecstatic yet I felt a little undeserving of this accomplishment. 
The summer prior to entering college, I spent most of my time with friends as we were all going separate ways.
I wanted to try all sorts of things beyond the bubble of high school: from food to activities around the Bay.
Experiencing new things is a lifelong motto of mine--the world is so vast and human life is so short.
Fun fact: I keep a list of things I want to do on my phone!

I came in really excited, ready to take on the world.
I looked forward to meeting all sorts of people and experiencing all sorts of things in a foreign area.

It's kind of like the honeymoon phase of a relationship where everything is new and exciting. 

Alright let's actually begin.

# Fall

I tried my best to keep updated on events for freshman and the school in general.
Notably, the Enormous Activity Fair (EAF) was both interesting and a little overwhelming.
Hundreds of clubs sprawled across Wilson Plaza and the Dixon Courts was a lot to take in.

In the end, I hadn't really signed up for any clubs.
Later, noticing this I tried to be more proactive for the sports clubs.

The Club Sports had booths around Drake Stadium, which I found a bit more managable and interesting.
Coming from a background of swim and water polo, I felt like continuing this streak of water sports.
I was split between sailing, rowing, and dragonboat.

Oddly enough, I didn't go to the sailing or rowing tryouts.
I either forgot, or their system for navigating freshman wasn't the best.

I went to a Dragonboat paddling workshop and later tryouts.
Honestly, I didn't really like the people or sport but it was interesting enough for me to stick around.

There's a bit more in my Physical Activity post if you are interested^^.

Besides Dragonboat, I also joined ACM and took part in their AI committee's projects track.
Over the course of the quarter, we would meet up weekly and work on an neural-network-related project. 
The people in charge were interesting and did well in explaining concepts but I felt a lack of personal connection among everyone.
Although I did make a friend there, I felt there was a lot more potential; I'm pretty sure the leads did not know most of our names.

Excluding dragonboat, I think I really struggled with finding a place to belong in the fall.

# Winter

Over the course of fall, I developed an interest in dance and found 
Foundations: a beginner dance club that accepted everyone who applied (first come first serve).
Although it was too late in the fall, I still checked out their auditions and made a note to apply next quarter. 
Thus in winter, I applied within the first few minutes of the form opening and got in :). 

Winter quarter was more of a loose quarter for me.
My classes had a very low time commitment so I invested a lot of time into dance.
Foundations had practice 7-11 pm twice a week, and occasional socials.
As a beginner with no prior experience, I also went to quite a few "office hours" led by the directors. 

One thing I was especially glad to experience was Wintensive: famous choreographers were invited to teach workshops at UCLA.
I couldn't go to Nick Joseph's due to a time conflict but I did go to [Anthony Lee's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oGTOMn9dxE&list=PL5idqdb0RICnYaTFyU6oRW8QDDwXceMgI) and that was really fun. 
I actually got to be right in front of him for a while by coincidence! It really changed my perspective of the intricacies in dance.

I can say with confidence that I've gotten more comfortable with my body, although there is still a ways to go.
I intend to join Foundations again (and hopefully againx2 as a captain!), during a quarter where my class load is a bit lighter.

# Spring

Tired of getting a haircut for my slightly overgrown hair every quarter, I decided to switch it up and bring back the buzz.
I had actually planned to join the Game Music Ensemble (GME) in Winter but didn't have the time for it.
I tried again in Spring: I brought my tenor sax mouthpiece and planned to borrow a tenor from the music department.
However, a music major had damaged their tenor and priority went to him as it was for his major and this was for a club.
Unfortunately, I didn't get to join the club but I did go to their benefit concert and even saw 
AverageJonas sing ["GunsForHire"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxH3pR095Sw) and "Warriors" live.
It was pretty insane, and I could have even played with him ahhhhhh.

The rest of spring quarter was pretty much me grinding for this notorious CS class.
Because the TA's managed homework, the professor taught us the things we needed to know a week after our first assignment was due.
Unfortunately poorly managed, I did gain a lot out of it; I guess growth comes from pain.

# Epilogue: To Sophomore Year
This year, I have a few plans (again). I plan to join GME, for real this time, and try out new sports.
One I had in mind since winter/spring quarter was fencing and a form of mma (which is offered at our gym!).
I also plan to join a more competitive CS club because I want the kind of environment where your team is as invested as you are in something.

For ACM, I ended up getting some kind of Dev Director officer role (mainly because no one wanted it)
and I plan to make some workshops/project tracks in the fall.
One of my goals, inspired by Matthew Wang, is to make it accessible and welcome to those with "no experience required",
as ACM is that kind of club in comparison to competitive/smaller based clubs.
