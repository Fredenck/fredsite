## Prologue
I fell for a scam last Nov/December. I'll keep it here as a mark of shame.

## Different Perspectives
This quarter I got to know some pretty interesting people.
It's always interesting seeing how different people conduct their lives.
I believe that we all develop a set of principles to live about, and there can be all sorts of principles.

Not exactly 'principles' but some of the things I'd like to incorporate into my life:
- waking up earlier and enjoy the ambience at The Study while being focused and getting work done
- doing random challenges with my future housemates: 24-hour In-n-Out, best chef, etc
- improve my functional physicality and enter a triathalon with a friend
- being a bit more outgoing and going out slightly more with the knowledge that things will work out.
- enjoy the present a bit more: smell the air, look at the sky; this moment will never happen again.

## Concerts
Got to go to quite a bit of concerts this quarter!

**Kenny Beats**

A friend had a last minute extra ticket to Kenny Beats, whom I didn't know of.
Being in the beginning of the quarter, I had time to spare and ended up going.
The opener was just alright but I did like some of Kenny's songs.
It was a bit weird going with people I didn't know but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.

**Sarah Kang**

Next, I finally got to go to Sarah Kang!
I'm quite a big fan of hers and this was her first? (and last tour for a while: she's pregnant)!
When she announced it November of last year, I knew I had to go but the question was with who?

I ended up asking a girl I thought was kind of cute and we went!
I had lots of fun and I think she did too, but we didn't text afterwards.
We're still friendly and always talk when we see each other, so I guess I don't need to think much of it.

Nieman opened for the concert, and I'm glad he did! His voice was authentic and he was super funny.
I'm loosely following him and would definitely go to another of his concerts.

</div>

This was my favorite concert (currently)! The venue was all standing GA, and we got to be super close, around the third row. 
With a smaller venue, you really feel closer to the performer. I'm convinced that we made eye contact and she smiled at me; even if it didn't happen, I'll pretend it did.
When you're right there in front of the artist, conversation feels so much more genuine.

Her smooth voice blended in really well with the background music and the stripped down setting really highlighted it.
Not only was Sarah Kang's voice amazing, her band also got to shine.
Near the end, the keyboardist had an extended solo, which I really appreciated considering my brief experience with classical and jazz music.

**Dynamic Duo**

I also had the chance to see Dynamic Duo, who performed at the Hammer museum to celebrate the 'Only the Young' exhibit!
I learned about it through my roomate, who had planned to go with his sister.
I invited a friend from my previous Foundations (dance) team because we hadn't talked in a while,
and DynamicDuo's "Smoke" gained a lot of popularity via Bada Lee's choreo.

I realized I hadn't talked to that friend since November; time really flies. While waiting in line (and after the concert, we got dessert) we talked about so much. We've both grown and have started thinking about our future.

Waving your hand to the beat of the music is pretty common in concerts. However, DynamicDuo got us to wave at double the speed I was expecting, which was a fresh perspective and actually really fun.

A highlight of the concert was DynamicDuo shh'ing us before a beat drop with them rapping. It's hard to describe but it was beautiful. 

Prior to the concert, I only really know their two most popular songs but I'm so glad I went!
I've become a much bigger fan of theirs, absolutely loving songs like 'Guilty' and 'Johnny'.
The cherry on top was seeing PROWDMON dance as well!

**Rocco**

I got tickets by coincidence, when trying to get YOASOBI's tickets. Unfortunately, she instantly sold out.
Dejected, I scrolled around on AXS (ticket site).
By chance, I recognized Rocco, whom I recently saw on Instagram.
A few of his songs gained traction through TikTok, so I listened to a few more songs and ended up getting tickets.

I didn't have anyone to go with, but after a thorough scan through my mind, I remembered my gym buddy from Dragonboat.
We have similar music tastes and she was super disappointed that she didn't know about Sarah Kang, so I invited her to this one.
We had a car this time, which was really nice as the Uber would've been more than the tickets themselves.

I enjoyed the concert; we got a solid good spot which wasn't too crowded yet relatively close.
His voice was really nice and I'm glad I got to know more of his songs. The saxophonist was also amazing, you had to see it.

I also got to catch up with my gym buddy. It was just last year when we were working out 3-5 times a week.
Talking with her is always an experience. She's cool.

It was interesting seeing the audience demographic compared to Sarah Kang;
Rocco had a lot of high schoolers while Sarah Kang had an older demographic.
Rocco also had more energy, but primarily due to the nature of his songs and stage presence.
In contrast, Sarah Kang's songs were slower and more heartfelt.

## Classes
Less work than expected, which is always a plus!
My schedule had 8 ams Mon-Fri, but near the second half of the quarter, I went to none (0) of them.

Because I wanted to join Foundations in the Spring again,
I purposely chose to take one of my harder major classes, Operating Systems, winter quarter. 

It was easier than expected, primarily due to the labs being reorganized following Professor Eyolfson's labs. 
Obviously, it wasn't easy just because Operating Systems is still Operating Systems.
Besides the weekly ~100 slides and additional readings assigned, I also read the OSTEP textbook (700+ pages).

I knew it was a reading-heavy class prior to taking the class, and had actually bought and started reading the textbook over winter break.

For one of the labs (worth 11% of your grade), I tarred the executable instead of source code.
This was a tricky mistake because the executable was named the same as the c file, so my eyes glazed over the missing .c extension when tarring.

I eventually recieved partial credit via proof of GitHub commit timestamps but still lost 30% of my original score of 100, leading to a -3.3% overall grade loss.

It irks me a bit that we still don't use autograders, or at least auto-file format checkers.
I know Berkeley does it with Gradescope's autograding and Prof. Eyolfson had it through GitHub organizations.
It's always silly to lose points on submitting incorrect files, but I guess it's a lesson to learn from;
the real world isn't so convenient to have these sanity checks done for you.

Despite all of that, I enjoyed the class.
A lot of it was about engineering principles applicable to real-world scenarios: balancing correctness with complexity/fairness, etc.
Plus, the OS is quite interesting and surprisingly similar to the human mind:
how abstraction on top of abstraction is manipulated, and how to handle multiple tasks while only being able to 'do one action at a time' via context switches.

Although most of it boiled down to 'common sense',
I believe each of the things we learned have their own niche worth understanding.
Mentioned by Professor Reiher, I'll probably never write os code but learning about how it works is still valuable.

The other notable unnotable class was 4AL. 

## BSA
Speaking of classes, I've got to talk about BSA. 

There's been multiple occasions where I'm chasing a feature/bug late at night, and decide to skip my 8 am the next morning.
I do watch the recorded lecture and review the slides to make up for it.
It's just that I don't want to pause while I'm currently pumping out a new feature.
There's something beautiful about chasing down that little thing in a state of complete focus.

Computer Science and Software Engineering are different. One is about theory-based and the other is about solving problems.

I've come to realize that I love solving problems. I love working on something that will be used by people.
I love working with an amazing team, chasing deadlines, and producing deliverables.
It's nice leading this project because everyone on the team is talented.
I'm able to work on all levels of the stack and white-box code review is fun!

Of course, there's days where I just can't figure it out no matter how late I stay up.
Sometimes, I end up going right back into it the next morning.
I remember one time, I had a BSA meeting at 7pm, got dinner,
then worked on an issue all the way until 1:30 AM (I usually sleep by 12). The next day, I woke up around 10 and worked until 1 PM.
I felt like a goblin leaving his mancave walking out of my dorm into the sun.

Usually when I'm stuck, I try to talk it out with my roomate or teammates, getting other perspectives.
Being able to take a step back and look at the situation to decide if this specific solution is really necessary is a beautiful skill.
Often, it's easier to change the problem/goal while maintaining important asepcts than forcefully adding a solution.

## ACM Design

Winter quarter meant the arrival of new interns! It was fun interviewing, and I was excited for a fresh perspective.
After all, these would be the next leaders of the club. During Fall, I started thinking about user retention and how to keep the club engaged. Looking back at my freshman year, the most exciting part was the project to redesign Grades of Green's website.

Despite not having the opportunity to implement it in code, working with clients was fun.
Having a project with weekly check up meetings is something that I really wanted to incorporate. Thus, I started looking towards something similar.

In the end, I found a local bakery that was being constructed, and worked out an agreement for us to design and create their website! It was definitely an interesting experience leading this project. I accounted for delays because things happen: club members were busy, construction materials were delayed. Despite that, we ended the quarter with almost a minimum viable product. I hope to complete this in the Spring, because everyone will have their own lives during summer.

Leading the team was tough, because a lot of them didn't have prior experience with programming. There's such a steep learning curve for this, but I tried to ease it to the best of my ability. A recurring thing I've noticed is that I enjoy teaching, but only when the student is willing to learn. There's a beauty in the unknown and potential to be explored. 

A nice memory I'd like to record is one of the first meetings. I worked with everyone to install all the configurations from Git to Node, and even VSCode from 6-8pm. After juggling so many people, I walked back to my dorm. Walking back in the chilly temperature and darkness yet seeing so many students out and about made it surreal. Samahang Modern (dance group) was doing a workshop in Bruin Plaza, one of the Kpop cover groups were practicing outside of the basketball courts in Wooden, people were playing soccor in the IM fields. I made it back in time just for dinner where I ran into my future housemate. Then, I played tennis with my roomate and saw a mutual friend from Club Tennis also on the courts! College is weird. 

BSA and ACM really pumped up this quarter, but I'm glad it did! Looking back, I've accomplished so much in 2 months. These clubs rekindled something in me and are really valuable experiences I'm glad to have experienced in college. Plus, these were heavy contributors to my technical skills and definitely played a role in landing my first official internship! I do wish I had done a bit more freshman year, but hindsight is 20/20; the only way is forward. 

## Staying up Later
Speaking of staying up later, this quarter I've stayed up later on other occasions as well.
One of my favorite things is coming back after a long day of classes and club meetings on a Friday night back to my dorm.
Often, my roomate and I would play tennis; when we got back, we would occasionally DoorDash some food and play TFT. 

It's really that cathartic feeling of having no worries at the present moment.
You're tired, showered and clean, have food you're craving for, and playing video games; we're all slaves of Maslow’s Hierarchy.

Other times, I'm catching up on a webtoon, comfortably snuggled up in my bed, knowing I can sleep in the next day.

It's a feeling I miss: last year, I was in Club Dragonboat, and had to sleep early (typpically 10-11 pm) to wake up at 5:30 am for practice at Long Beach.

## Fencing
After learning basic footwork and watching experienced fencers fence, I realized that I'm way too slow.
Yes everything is technically passable but I lack the explosivenss and speed. Focusing on that with my lunge has been fun.
I'm in the process of turning it into my own weapon.

I've also come to appreciate how fencing is beneficial for your hips. Throughout high school and a lot of college, I was always sitting. 
It wasn't until I injured my hip fall of freshman year that I realized how atrophied they were.
Hip flexors are so important and fencing movements really activate them.

Despite planning to be more outgoing/friendly, I didn't get that far. I had a few nice interactions with my club members, but not to the level I want.
A critique I have with the club is that most experienced fencers are noncommital.
They show up once every few weeks when practice is twice a week. While I do look up to their skill, it's hard to look up to them as a fencer. I want to be around fencers who want to improve; most advanced people are past that stage and usually peaked in high school.

Another critique is the amount of downtime we have. Practice is typically 2 hours, but we usually start late and spend a while working on drills (which isn't bad).
The actual time spent on strips is minimal and we sometimes have to share it with other swords.
Arguably the most time-consuming aspect is the small talk between every point; I just want to fence.
I usually only end up fencing once or twice in the entire practice despite each bout being only around 3 minutes long.

The club is more social than technical, yet awkward.
I remember during the last few practices we were to warm up by ourselves.
After minimal warming up, most members sat down yet didn't even converse with each other.

It's contradictory to me that people would rather sit down and do nothing instead of either warming up, working on footwork, or even talking to each other.
I don't feel the passion or love for the sport in the club.

Don't get me wrong, I like the sport. Fencing on the strip is exhilarating. Utilizing a powerful lunge or baiting the opponent and counterattacking is fun. I just don't click with the club.
I believe that you should give to the club and get from the club. I'm not getting as much as I want.

On the other hand, less and less people have been showing up. That's great because I get so much more time on the strip. I visibly notice my improvement.

Because I had planned to join Foundations spring, I had to give up either Fencing or Tennis, as they were MW and TR night, respectively.
With a lot of delibration, I've decided to quit fencing. 
Despite that, I did sign up for a tournament a few weeks into April. I want to compete at least once before dropping it.

Sometimes I doubt myself for trying all these things just to be mediocre at it. It's a little rough when I see people I know work towards their career and find success in that while I'm out here playing around. It's the question of moving towards a better future vs appreciating the present.

In the end, I don't regret anything. Experiencing new things is a core value of mine. I know that time is limited and sacrifices must be made. As I'm getting older, I'm starting to prioritize the things that matter to me; rather than expanding horizontally, I'm starting to prioritize expanding vertically. That's how you can become great at something.

## Tennis
Tennis is the opposite. Between the two, I enjoy the sport of fencing more; however, Tennis excels in everything else.
I love the cool, crisp air during 9-11 pm practices at LATC. The sound of balls being hit and bouncing on the hard court is one of a kind.
The overhead lights and music make everything so much better. 

Club Tennis is somehow more social yet more competitive than Fencing.
It's nice talking to other club members while waiting in line, and the line never takes too long.

If you're on a roll, you get to stay on the King court.
Getting in the zone is difficult, especially when my foundational skill isn't up there.
However, it's nice getting near that state, getting the engine running.
It's a mixture of adrenaline and focus combined with breathing in the cool, crisp air and exhaling out all of the CO2 in your lungs.

One flaw would be that you aren't really taught anything, and it can be tough to improve.
Thankfully, my roomate and I often hit with each other; that's where most of my improvement comes from.

I also got to meet some really cool people there, and I'm glad I did. There's a group of friends I've made that go beyond being friends during practice; sometimes we go to someone's apartment and stay up late playing games or other times get food!

## Rooming
Housing is typically decided around winter quarter of the previous year.
This year was a bit different because I had to consider housemates, moving from a dorm to an apartment,
and whether that apartment would be from ucla or not.

First, I had already had some housemates in mind: I would room with my current roomate and house with two close friends in dragonboat. I asked early and they were enthusiastic.

Second, I had to consider the current dragonboat apartment; one person was graduating. I get along really well with all of the people in it and was considering living with them. These people are so unique yet meld really well together. It's literally a once in a lifetime experience so I was really considering it.

Third, someone from BSA reached out and had an extra spot. He's someone I respect a lot and someone I wanted to get closer too.

Fourth, one of my friends with his roomate also reached out if I wanted to be housemates. He's also someone I really want to get closer too. We really click and I can tell both of us are trying to get closer. However, it's tough because we have different lives with little overlap. At this time, I had already agreed to house with the first people I had in mind. I brought it up, and everyone wasn't particularly opposed to a 6 person apartment but we did prefer a 4-person.

In the end, I opted to go with my first option because I really like my current roomates, and wanted some stability.
The person graduating in the second option actually decided to stay for one more year, which worked out for both of us.
The third and fourth options eventually found someone else.

I like my current relationship with all these people. Living with them would change the relationship to some degree, as living with someone and being friends are two separate things. I hope to still be as close to them as I am, and promised to invite them over and cook for them next year.

## Dance
It's been more than a year since I last danced on a team. I went to Shiggy's class during Wintensive and had a lot of fun learning a choreo to Laufey's "From the Start" (crazy coincidence: the frat across my dorm is playing this song right now as I type).

As always, I watched the quarterly Foundations showcase. This was a treat because I got to see two new teams perform, F7^3 and Projected. They were relatively smaller teams but were really clean; something that I'd want to be apart of. Dance is one of the things that I've settled on to commit too. There's so many times I've seen people either on stage or on video, and thought "I want to be like that". I'm really looking forward to my growth as a dancer during Foundations next quarter.

## Afterword
I've really grown this quarter. Career wise, it was a little rough being a CS major in these trying times. I ended up getting to one company's final interview stage in the fall, and another during winter break.

To be fair, I wasn't giving it my all during applications (and even the interview itself) because I believed that this year was just like that. When I got back for winter break, my friend at Berkeley completely flipped my perspective. We had always been pretty similar in academics and I often benchmarked myself with him. It was pretty insane seeing the things he was doing and it gave me a lot of determination. I reformatted my resume to be more ATS friendly and started looking back to see my identity. 

This quarter, through an accidental leadership position in BSA and ACM, I've grown so much. Through these, and all of the other experiences in college, I've begun to solidify my identity as an individual. That's why I decided to subtitle this post as "refinement and levleing up".

I remember preparing for my interview in the lounge, 10 pm on a Friday night. I didn't feel any FOMO, any urge to go out, or any loneliness; I simply enjoyed the ambient silence while the gears turning in my head.

I've grown. I'm glad I did. Whenever I look back to my previous selves, I'm a little surprised. I was more unhinged, with little care about the world. I shaved my head for fun, twice (and hopefully one more time ?). I would do whatever I felt like doing. Now, I feel like I've lost a bit of that when growing up. I still see the playful and blunt aspects from time to time, but it's on a smaller scale now.

On a side note, this quarter consisted of a lot of reading (for 111).

On March 20th, 2024 I was studying for my finals and took a little break:

> I stood outside of Bplate, listening to the imperfect but ambient piano playing.
>
> The air was crisp and fresh.\
> Gazing at the IM fields, I watched the singular student in orange, dribble a soccor ball.\
> I watched the girl running around the perimeter of the track.\
> I watched the sunlight against the Fowler Museum, propped by the backdrop of the blue sky.\
> I breathed.
> 
> From the corner of my eye, I saw the trickle of cars stopping at the stop sign,\
> I saw the slow-moving figures of of students fade out of site as they walked to the gym.\
> All with the soft yet distinct noise of car engine's and people's chit-chat entwined with the piano.
> 
> This very moment felt magical. I'm glad to be here.
