description: How these made such a lasting impact on me
---
A significant chunk of my morals and being stems from the anime, manga, webtoons, and more I have consumed.

# Anime
It all began with *Naruto*. Recommended by a friend, it was my first experience with anime, without knowing what anime was.

It was a combination of animation style, music, story, and emotion that drew me to the series.
I was fascinated by the concept of ninjas with superhuman capabilities and the power of chakra.
Naruto's alienation and loneliness stirred my heart. Everything was perfect. 
6th grade me teared up in the first episode and I would secretly stay up late to watch episodes in the dark.
[Naruto ED 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyhpwyrq1N0) holds so much nostalgic value to me. 
In fact, my obsession with Naruto even lead to Naruto fanfiction; I would binge chapters before I slept. 

Another anime I have to mention is the *Monogatari* series. Though it bears a bad rep, the storytelling is amazing. 
By the summer between 9th and 10th grade, I had already watched a large amount of anime across all genres;
feel free to check out my [list](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/fredenck?status=7&order=4&order2=0)
(Note that 1) I've only included ratings for the first season of most multi-seasoned series 
because I'm lazy and thinks it's redundant, and 2) there's so many anime that I had to be really rigorous with my ratings, see my MAL profile).
Then I stumbled upon the *Monogatari* series.

> Dialogue driven by complex 3-dimensional characters, the serie's unique art style and cut-scenes captivate the audience

I can't quantify what this series did to me, but one aspect it definitely changed was my way of thinking.
I would highly recommend this series (start with Bakemonogatari) but I admit that it can get tedious at times due to the dialogue narrative.
I believe it's the kind of entertainment that shuold be consumed when you have a lot of time, such as the summer. 

# Manga
I've never been a big manga fan because I'm heavily biased towards animation, colors, and music.
Plus, most manga of quality have already been animated so I tend to watch the anime. 
However, there is one notable manga I must discuss: *Vagabond*.
It's a beautiful manga and would be immensely difficult to create an anime that would do Takehiko's art justice.

# Light Novels 
I typically don't read light novels because I enjoy animation, pictures, and color.
The few I've read were just alright and I sometimes got confused.
The one exception is *Classroom of the Elite* (COTE).
I first watched this as an anime recommended by a friend (the same one who recommended *Naruto*).
The animation, music, and art were all pretty good and I was really into the plot twists.
I also liked the idea of a genius/mastermind trying to stay hidden/discreet.
Anyways, I rewatched it a few times and sought more.
Apparently the manga was poorly done and everyone online seemed to favor the light novel.
Thus, I started snooping around the internet for translated versions of the light novel.
This was actually really difficult as they're not public and COTE wasn't that popular. 
I ended up catching up to the translated version but wanted more
so I eventually found fan-translated site and kept up with it for a long time. 

Last week I actually bought the LN to get the Amazon free shipping and I'm currently re-reading it :)

# Manhwa
I've probably spent the second-most amount of time with this after anime.
I'm a big fan of manhwa because most have color and are really well made.
I'm a little tired so I'll just end this with a few that have a special place in my heart in no particular order:
- *Bastard*
- *Wind Breaker*
- *Solo Leveling*
- *Reincarnation of the Suicidal Battle God*
- *Eleceed*
- *Seasons of Blossom*
- *The Girl Downstairs*
