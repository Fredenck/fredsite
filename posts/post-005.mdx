A large part of my morals and being stems from the anime, manga, webtoons, and more I have consumed.

# Anime
It all began with *Naruto*. Recommended by a friend, it was my first experience with anime, without knowing what anime was.

It was a combination of animation style, music, story, and emotion that drew me to the series.
I was fascinated by the concept of superhuman ninjas and chakra.
Naruto's alienation and loneliness stirred my heart.
6th grade me teared up in the first episode and I would secretly stay up late to watch episodes in the dark.
[Naruto ED 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyhpwyrq1N0) is full of nostalgia.
In fact, my obsession with Naruto even lead to Naruto fanfiction which I would binge before sleeping.

By the summer between 9th and 10th grade, I had already watched a large amount of anime across all genres;

After so watching so many different anime, I stumbled upon the *Monogatari* series.
Though it bears a bad rep, the storytelling is amazing.

> Dialogue driven by complex 3-dimensional characters, the serie's unique art style and cut-scenes captivate the audience

*Monogatari* changed my way of thinking.
The story is loosely based around complex 3-dimensional characters and supernatural phenomena.
Driven by dialogue, it can feel lackluster at times but culminates into an amazing story in the end.

# Manga
I've never been a big manga fan because I'm heavily biased towards animation, colors, and music.
Plus, most manga of quality have already been animated so I tend to watch the anime. 

One thing I do give credit for is the level of detail and artistic quality that manga has.
Often, anime adaptions can't replicate the drawn art style such as *Vagabond* and *Berserk*.

# Light Novels 
I typically don't read light novels because I enjoy animation, pictures, and color.
The few I've read were just alright and can be confusing at times.

An exception is *Classroom of the Elite*.
The friend who recommended me *Naruto* also recommended *Classroom of the Elite*.
The anime's animation, music, and art were all solid and I was really into the plot twists and hidden mastermind.

I actually rewatched it quite a few times because it was so enjoyable.
Lamenting about the lack of a sequel (the anime was to promote the light novel),
I looked towards content from the manga and light novel.

The manga had critical reviews and everyone seemed to recommend the light novel
so I started searching.
This was actually really difficult as they're not public and *Classroom of the Elite* wasn't that popular at the time. 

# Manhwa
I've probably spent the second-most amount of time with this after anime.
I'm a big fan of manhwa because most have color and are really well made.
Some of my favorites include:
- *Bastard*
- *Wind Breaker*
- *Solo Leveling*
- *Reincarnation of the Suicidal Battle God*
- *Eleceed*
- *Seasons of Blossom*
- *The Girl Downstairs*
