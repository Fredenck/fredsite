description: My thoughts on being physically active
---

Since 5th grade, I started swimming. 
I didn't have any particular feelings for the sport but my mom wanted me to be active so I had to do it.
Sometimes it was fun, sometimes it was miserable: forced to swim a neverending set in the freezing water while it was pitch black outside; 
I remember asking to use the bathroom just to thaw myself in the steam room.

<br></br>

Nevertheless, I stuck with swimming and it grew on me. 
In high school, I had the desire to reach Varsity and the more I swam, the more I enjoyed it.
Cutting through the water, effortlessly, is a special kind of sensation that only swimmers can understand.

<br></br>

I also stumbled upon Water Polo in high school. This comes with a mixture of positive and negative emotions.
At first, I loved it. It was tough practicing from 6 to 9 pm every day, and took even longer with the commute and shower afterwards.
It was worth it though. Amazing upperclassmen, teammates, and coach created a lasting impression on a young me.

<br></br>

However, I was a scrawny underweight kid. I wasn't strong or skilled. That led me to going to the gym for the first time. 
There, I didn't really know what I was doing and I didn't really know anatomy either.
I was really just moving around weights rather than actually working out.
I soon stopped because I didn't see much progress and had to focus on my studies, quite an important thing for me during high school.

<br></br>

Fast forward past covid, I was a senior in high school. 
Most of my teammates from freshman year didn't play and I was a bit isolated from everyone else for not having much in common.
In the end, I was just alright and became a benchwarmer. 
I wanted to get better but there was no system to get better; practice felt like a waste of time.
After a series of games with barely any play time, I resolved to quit. 
I was so conflicted because I wasn't good enough to play the game I loved and I couldn't get good. 
I was wasting my time going to practice and not getting much out of it. 
I was wasting my time going to games just to sit in the water on the side and watch my team the entire game.
Telling my coach that I was going to quit was difficult: I broke down crying while telling him.
Internally, I blamed him for a lack of coaching and support although I am biased.
It felt as though the system was working against me and anything I did could not change anything.

<br></br>

Anyways with swim season coming up, I put time into practicing for that. I think I enjoyed swim season.
I got used to sleeping around 10 pm and waking at 5:30 am. Practice was 6-7 am and I had Jazz Band, a 0-period elective, after that.
I still wasn't very fast but it was whatever. At least I got to play the sport and I liked swimming. 
I also had these two underclassmen that I liked and would occasionally drive them around.

<br></br>

In terms of the gym, I started going consistently after swim season. I went 6 days a week, following a push pull legs split.
However, I don't think I was working out as efficiently as I could have.
Throughout the following school year, I kind of developed a way of working out that best suited me.
Even though I only went 3 times a week, I was making more progress and gaining more muscle. 
My focus really shifted from quantity to quality and I started getting the hang of the mind-muscle connection. 
I started caring more about the food I ate and the sleep I got. I didn't count to the gram of protein I was taking, but tried to learn towards eating more protein rich foods.
I believe that we all have different routines for optimal growth because of the difference in our genetics and body. 
Some people will have a body where it's much easier to grow muscle in one specific area which their optimal routine different from others. 
I'm still figuring out mine day by day, but I've gotten a good grasp of how to best work my body and there are results showing that.
It's pretty amazing what the human body of a 19 year old boy can do when given the right conditions.

<br></br>

Entering college, I wanted to try a new water-related sport.
Although the gym is makes the most progress, sports is always something special to me.
There's a beauty in the sport as well as the people who play it.
I ended up trying out for Dragonboat and getting in.
As a club sport, it was extremely social while also staying competitive. 
Just thinking about certain members of the team makes me smile. I believe the community UCLA Dragonboat has created is so special. 
The organization's unique structure and sport has created such a unique bond between all ~50 of us.
You know it's something else when everyone willingly wakes up at 5:00 am every Saturday and Sunday.

<br></br>

This coming year, I decided to take a small break for dragonboat. 
While it is amazing, it is an intense commitment and I want to branch out and explore all the things college has.
I'm going to check out sailing and rowing and will probably play basketball or volleyball on the side.
Tennis also seems interesting, but I'd need a racket. Checking out the MMA classes at Wooden is also on my bucket list, though I might not get to it in the fall.
All of that aside, I still plan to go to the gym 3 days a week on the days I'm not doing a sport.
