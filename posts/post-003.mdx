description: My thoughts on being physically active
---

In 5th grade I started swimming. 
I didn't have particular feelings for the sport, but my mom wanted me to be active.
Sometimes it was fun, sometimes it was miserable: forced to swim a neverending set in the freezing water while it was pitch black outside; 
I remember asking to use the bathroom to thaw myself in the steam room.

<br></br>

Nevertheless, I stuck with swimming; it slowly grew on me. 
In my high school team, I sought to be placed in Varsity.
The more I practiced and swam, the more I liked swimming: effortlessly cutting through the water, you feel as though you are flying.

I also stumbled upon Water Polo in high school. This comes with a mixture of positive and negative emotions.
At first, I loved it. It was tough practicing from 6 to 9 pm every day, and it took even longer with the commute and shower afterwards.
It was worth it, though. Golden upper-classmen, teammates, and coach imprinted a lasting impression on a young me. I idolzed the seniors.

Scrawny and underweight, I wasn't strong or skilled. Eventually, I tried going to the gym for the first time. 
I didn't know what I was doing there, and I didn't understand anatomy either.
I was just moving around weights with improper form in contrast to strength training.
I soon stopped because I didn't see much progress and had to focus on my studies, something my parents and I stressed during high school.

<br></br>

Fast forward past covid, I was a senior in high school. 
Most of my teammates from my freshman year stopped playing, and I was a bit isolated from the rest of the team for not having much in common.
In the end, I was just alright and became a benchwarmer. 
I wanted to improve, but there was no system to progress; practice felt like a waste of time with an uncaring coach and distracted teammates.
After a series of games with barely any play time, I resolved to quit. 
I was conflicted because I wasn't good enough to play the game I loved, yet I couldn't get good. 
I was wasting my time going to practice and not getting much out of it. 
I was wasting my time driving to games just to sit in the water on the side and watch my team the entire game. Whether we won or last, I would always be on the side.
Telling my coach that I was going to quit was difficult: I broke down, crying in the middle of my resignation.
Internally, I blamed him for a lack of coaching and support, although I am biased.
It felt like the system was working against me, and anything I did would not change anything.
A different team and coach, the same sport but different.

Moving on, swim season was coming up. I put time into practicing for that. I think I enjoyed swim season.
I began sleeping around 10 pm and waking at 5:30 am. Practice was 6-7 am then I had Jazz Band, a 0-period elective, after that.
I still wasn't very fast, but it was whatever. At least I got to play the sport, plus I liked swimming. 
I also had two underclassmen that I adored; I would occasionally drive them around.

In terms of the gym, I started going consistently after swim season. I went 6 days a week and followed a push pull legs split.
However, I don't think I was working out as efficiently as I could have.
Throughout the following school year, I developed a way of working out that best suited me.
Even though I only went 3 times a week, I was making more progress and gaining muscle. 
My focus shifted from quantity to quality, and I started getting the hang of the mind-muscle connection. 
I started caring more about the food I ate and the sleep I got. I didn't count my protein intake in grams but always tried to eat healthier, protein-rich foods.
A belief of mine is that we all have different bodies due to genetics and life growing up (nature and nurture). Thus, efficient training is different for everyone, and there is no perfect training regime. 
I'm still figuring out mine day by day, but I've gotten a good grasp of how to best work my body; I can see and feel the difference.
It's pretty amazing what the human body of a 19 year old boy can do when given the right conditions.

I gained an average of 15 pounds from fall to spring. A large part of it is due to the food at UCLA.
After coming home for summer break, maintaining my diet is difficult: my parents don't eat much and often skip lunch. 
I usually eat two eggs and sometimes a bagel or croissant for breakfast. However, I often end up eating leftovers or even skip lunch rather than cooking a new meal during lunch.

Entering college, I wanted to try a new water-related sport.
Although the gym makes the most progress, sports is always something special to me.
There's a beauty in the sport and the people who play it.
I ended up trying out for Dragonboat and getting in.
As a club sport, it was social while also competitive. 
Just thinking about certain members of the team makes me smile. I believe the community UCLA Dragonboat has created is special. Everyone on the 50 person team shares some a bond with each other. Sure, some bonds may be tighter than others, but there's still a sense of camaderie between everyone at the end of the day.
You know it's something else when everyone willingly wakes up at 5:00 am every Saturday and Sunday.

This coming year, I decided to take a small break for dragonboat. 
While I love the people, I'm not a big fan of the sport. As a paddler, you train for one side of the boat. This leads to muscle imbalance, and the sport is injury prone. In fact, I strained my hip back in November due to training and still experience discomfort in July. It began with a strained hip leading to Iliotibial band syndrome, hamstring strain, and whatnot. A big reason why I still suffer from this is that I didn't take care of my injury when it was still fresh. I wanted to be in peak condition for my first race and disregarded the pain. 
Another reason I'm taking a break is that I want to experience other aspects of UCLA as Dragonboat is an intense time and emotional commitment.
In the fall, I plan to check out sailing and rowing, and hopefully play basketball or volleyball on the side.
Tennis also seems interesting, but I'd need a racket. Checking out the MMA classes at Wooden is also on my bucket list, though I might not get to it in the fall.
