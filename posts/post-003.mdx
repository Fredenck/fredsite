I've always been relatively active. 

I first played soccer back in Idaho.
I was alright for a kid; my athleticism made up for my lack of ball control.
When I moved to California, I'm not sure why I stopped playing,
but I ended up trying a bunch of different sports.

I didn't really like any of them but eventually settled with swimming.
I didn't have particular feelings for the sport, but my mom wanted me to be active (something I'm thankful for).

Swim grew on me. It's a fantastic way to exercise because it recruits many muscles and is easy on the joints.
Swimming sets was tiring but it made the rest in between worthwile.
Plus, there's something about suffering with your friends.
Sometimes we would be forced to swim a neverending set in freezing water while it was pitch black outside; 
I remember asking to use the bathroom to thaw myself in the steam room.

In my high school team, I tried to make Varsity because that's where fast people who swam club went.
Chasing after that was self rewarding.
Taking something seriously by putting in the work and seeing results was really exciting.
The more I swam, the more I enjoyed it: effortlessly cutting through the water, you feel as though you are flying.
I wasn't fast but not slow either.

Having swam, I eventually discovered Water Polo in high school.
At first, I loved it. It was tough practicing from 6 to 9 pm every day, and it took even longer with the commute and shower.
It was worth it, though. Golden upper-classmen, teammates, and coach imprinted a lasting impression on a young me. I idolized the seniors.

Scrawny and underweight, I wasn't strong or skilled.
I eventually tried going to the gym.
I didn't know what I was doing there, and I didn't understand anatomy either.
I was just throwing around weights with improper form.
I soon stopped because I didn't see much progress and had to focus on my studies, which took priority.

Fast forward past covid, I was a senior in high school.

Most of my teammates from my freshman year stopped playing, 
and I was a bit isolated from the rest of the team as a senior.
In the end, I was just alright and a benchwarmer. 
I wanted to improve, but there was no system to progress;
practice felt like a waste of time with an uncaring coach and distracted teammates.
It felt like no one cared and was frustrating because it was an new team and coach that didn't experience what I saw in my freshman year.

After a series of games with barely any play time, I resolved to quit.
I was conflicted because I wasn't good enough to play the game I loved, yet I couldn't get good. 
I was wasting my time going to practice just to be mediocre and watch on the sidelines.
Telling my coach that I was going to quit was difficult:
I broke down, crying in the middle of my resignation.
Internally, I blamed him for a lack of coaching and support, although I am biased.
It felt like the system was working against me, and anything I did would not change anything.
A different team and coach and the same sport, but it was different.

Water Polo's was in the fall and swim in the spring.

I enjoyed swim season.
I began sleeping around 10 and waking at 5:30. Practice was 6-7 am then I had Jazz Band, a 0-period elective.
I still wasn't very fast, but it was whatever. At least I got to play the sport, plus I liked swimming. 
I also had two underclassmen that I adored and occasionally drove to/from races.

After swim ended, I started going to the gym more. I went 6 days a week and following a PPL split.
However, I wasn't very efficient. I wasn't really engaging my muscles and I could have pushed myself harder.

Later in college, I started focusing on the fundamental principles.
Even though I only went 3 times a week, I was making more progress and gaining muscle. 
My focus shifted from quantity to quality, and I started getting the hang of mind-muscle connection. 
I started caring more about the food I ate and the sleep I got. 
Though I didn't count my protein intake, I always tried to eat healthier, protein-rich foods.

I strongly believe that our bodies are unique from genetics and the environment growing up (nature and nurture).
There is no one-fits-all training regime. 
I'm still figuring out mine, but I've definitely become more in sync with my body.
It's pretty amazing how the body changes, especially when you're young.

I gained an average of 15 pounds from fall to spring. A large part of it is due to the food at UCLA.

After coming home for summer break, maintaining my diet is difficult: my parents don't eat much and often skip lunch. 
I usually eat two eggs and sometimes a bagel or croissant for breakfast but sometimes I stay up late and skip breakfast.
Lunch was difficult because I can't really cook so I often eat leftovers or have some basic chicken and rice.

Entering college, I wanted to try a new water-related sport.
Although the gym makes the most progress, sports are special to me.
There's a beauty in the sport and the people who play it.
Plus, it's much harder to join a team sport after college whereas you can always go to the gym.

I ended up joining Dragonboat.
As a club sport, it was social while also competitive. 
Just thinking about certain members of the team makes me smile.
I believe the community UCLA Dragonboat has created is special.
Everyone on the 50 person team shares some a bond with each other.
Sure, some bonds may be tighter than others,
but there's still a sense of camaderie between everyone at the end of the day.
You know it's something else when everyone willingly wakes up at 5 in the morning every Saturday and Sunday.

From AYCE KBBQ to the heavy fog or parking issues with snow during Ski Trip and random socials here and there, 
I had so much fun with the team outside of practice.
Plus after races, it's so nice to celebrate with the team at a new place. For College Cup, we drove up to SF and raced there.
Afterwards, my car got to explore the city and it was so much fun!
Though Tempe was cancelled, we had a really good race at Baby Long Beach.

This coming year, I decided to take a break for dragonboat. 
While I love the people, I hate the sport.
As a paddler, you train for one side of the boat leading to muscle imbalance and injuries.
In fact, I strained my hip back in November due to training and still experience discomfort now in July.
Eager to perform well at my first race, I ignored my pain, exacerbating a minor injury.
One injury led to others. It's something I'm really careful about now.

Another reason I'm taking a break is that I want to experience other aspects of UCLA.
Dragonboat is an intense time and emotional commitment.

In the fall, I plan to check out sailing and rowing, and hopefully play basketball or volleyball on the side.
Tennis also seems interesting, but I'd need a racket. Checking out the MMA classes at Wooden is also on my bucket list, though I might not get to it in the fall.
