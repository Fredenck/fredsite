# My Name
My name, I would not be named anything else, was inspired by a random building at UIUC:
The Frederick Seitz Materials Research Lab.

I was born in Urbana but only lived in Illinois for one month before moving to Idaho.
Boise, Idaho.

From ages 1 month to 9 years, I lived in Boise, Idaho. Some precious memories:

# White Pine
White Pine, the school I attended, had a GATE program combining 1st and 2nd grade, and 3rd and 4th grade.
My 1st/2nd grade teacher, Ms. Manning-Floch, was wonderful.
She was French, and would always say *bon apetit* before she dismissed us for lunch.
I also distinctly remember our class getting stuffed animals for an uknown reason;
I got a teddy bear with boxing gloves and shorts which I still have today!

I was a shy kid.
Due to my parents and Ms. Manning-Floch's encouragement, I started raising my hand more in second grade.
In fact, I was obnoxiously raising my hand for every other question...
When I moved to 3rd grade, Ms. Manning-Floch also switched to teaching the 3rd/4th GATE class.
Since I moved away after 3rd grade, she was my only teacher at White Pine.
I absolutely love herâ€”she reminds me of Ms. Frizzle (I think she had orangeish hair? and was super nice).

# Montessori
I went to Montessori Daycare for a bit.
I don't remember much besides crying after my dad left on the first day, thinking I had been abandoned.
I also remember gagging because of another kid was throwing up.
It was pretty fun there, and we had a nap time!
We also had a circular path outside for bikes, I think.
I remember crashing on a turn and getting a large cut across my chest.
Surprisingly, I don't think I cried and felt no pain until they put alcohol on the wound (probably the adrenaline or shock).
At the time, the wound seemed to streak across my chest; honestly a part of me thinks that the wound would look cool if it scarred.

# My First and Second Houses
Carie Way. I don't remember much of my first house, probably because I was too young. 
We had a nice little backyard with a peach tree that always had bugs and a grapevine along the roof.
There was also a couch I used to hide behind when my parents were fighting.
Outside was nice, especially around Halloween and Christmas where our neighbors would put up stuff.
There was also this open area which had a bunch of rocks that had crystals when broken.
I think that area had a small hill which I once went down when it snowed.

Ridgeview Drive. I have a bit more memories of this amazing house with two stories and a basement.
Our backyard was amazing.
The door opened to a sprawling hill against the Rocky? Mountains.
Near the center of the hill was a small two-level pond.
On the side there was a tree sprouting magnificent flowers in the spring.
When it snowed, it was beautiful; I've seen deer and heard of bobcats.

# House Parties
As an asian minority in Idaho, we knew most other chinese families in the area.
In fact, we frequently had house parties where I got to meet other kids as well.

# After School
Another core memory was after school. Once school ended, I would race against my friends to the bus stop. 
Everyday, we went to a friend's house for afterschool. 
There, we did homework, occasionally had art classes, and fooled around as kids.
One time, the art teacher gifted us these rainbow color pencils which was revolutionary.

One of my favorite memories is us crowded around the sofa playing Mario Kart Wii and Wii Party.
To this day, I still love those games.
Though I don't have any pictures of then, I did find an old picture of me with another one of my closest friends.
