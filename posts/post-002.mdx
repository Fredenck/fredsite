# My Name
My name, probably the best name ever, was inspired by a random building at UIUC: Frederick Seitz Materials Research Lab
(my parents did their doctorates at UIUC).

I was born in Urbana but only lived in Illinois for one month before moving to Idaho. Boise, Idaho.

From ages 1 month to 9 years, I lived in Boise, Idaho. Some precious memories:

# White Pine
White Pine, the school I attended, had a GATE program which combined 1st graders with 2nd graders and 3rd graders with 4th graders.
My 1st/2nd grade teacher, Ms. Manning-Floch, was a wonderful French teacher and would always say *bon apetit* before lunch.
I also distinctly remember our class getting stuffed animals for some reason; I got a teddy bear with boxing gloves and shorts.

Somewhere between 1st and 3rd grade I started raising my hand more. 
In fact, I think I was obnoxiously raising my hand for every question...
When I went to 3rd grade, Ms. Manning-Floch switched to teaching 3rd/4th grade. 
Since I moved away after 3rd grade, she was my only teacher at White Pine.

# Montessori
I went to Montessori Daycare for a bit. I don't remember much besides crying after my dad left on the first day, thinking I had been abandoned. 
It was pretty fun there, and we had a nap time. I thinkwe also had a circular path outside for bikes?
I remember crashing on a turn and getting a large cut across my chest. Surprisingly I don't think I cried and felt no pain until they put alcohol on the wound (probably the adrenaline).
At the time, the wound seemed to streak across my chest; honestly a part of me thinks that the wound would look cool if it scarred.

# My Second House
2106 S Ridgeview Drive. I used to live in this amazing house with two stories and a basement.
Our backyard was just as nice. It was a sprawling hill with a tree with beautiful flowers in the spring and a pond on the slope.
When it snowed, it was beautiful.

# After School
Another core memory was after school. Once school ended, I would race against my friends to the bus stop. 
Everyday, we went to a friend's house for afterschool. 
There, we did homework, occasionally had art classes, and fooled around as kids. 
A distinct memory I have is us crowded around the sofa playing Mario Kart Wii and Wii Party.
Though I don't have any pictures of then, I did find an old picture of me with another one of my closest friends.
