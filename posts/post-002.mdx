description: From ages 1 month to 9 years, I lived in Boise, Idaho

My name, probably the best name ever, was inspired by the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Lab: a building at UIUC, where my parents did their doctorates.


I was born there, in Urbana, but only lived in Illinois for one month before moving to Idaho. Boise, Idaho.


From ages 1 month to 9 years, I lived in Boise, Idaho. Some precious memories:


White Pine, the school I went to, had a GATE program which combined 1st and 2nd graders, and 3rd and 4th graders.
My 1st/2nd grade teacher, Ms. Manning-Floch--a wonderful French teacher--would always say *bon apetit* before lunch.
I also distinctly remember our class getting stuffed animals for some reason; I got a teddy bear with boxing gloves and shorts.
Somewhere between 1st and 3rd grade I started raising my hand more. In fact, I think I was obnoxiously raising my hand for every question...
When I went to 3rd grade, Ms. Manning-Floch switched to teaching 3rd/4th grade. Since I moved away after 3rd grade, she was my only teacher at school.


As a kid, I was a reader. I read all Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Eragon, and much more. 


I went to Montessori Daycare for a bit. I remember the first day, I cried after my dad left. 
It was pretty fun there and we had a nap time. We also had bikes?
I remember crashing on a turn and getting a large cut across my chest.
