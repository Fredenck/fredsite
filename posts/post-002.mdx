# My Name
My name, probably the best name ever, was inspired by a random building at UIUC: Frederick Seitz Materials Research Lab
(my parents did their doctorates at UIUC).

<br></br>

I was born in Urbana but only lived in Illinois for one month before moving to Idaho. Boise, Idaho.

<br></br>

From ages 1 month to 9 years, I lived in Boise, Idaho. Some precious memories:

<br></br>

# White Pine
White Pine, the school I went to, had a GATE program which combined 1st and 2nd graders, and 3rd and 4th graders.
My 1st/2nd grade teacher, Ms. Manning-Floch--a wonderful French teacher--would always say *bon apetit* before lunch.
I also distinctly remember our class getting stuffed animals for some reason; I got a teddy bear with boxing gloves and shorts.
Somewhere between 1st and 3rd grade I started raising my hand more. In fact, I think I was obnoxiously raising my hand for every question...
When I went to 3rd grade, Ms. Manning-Floch switched to teaching 3rd/4th grade. 
Since I moved away after 3rd grade, she was my only teacher at White Pine.

# Montessori
I went to Montessori Daycare for a bit. I remember the first day, I cried after my dad left. 
It was pretty fun there and we had a nap time. We also had bikes?
I remember crashing on a turn and getting a large cut across my chest.

# My Second House
2106 S Ridgeview Drive. I used to live in this amazing house with two stories and a basement.
Our backyard was just as nice. It was a sprawling hill with a tree that had beautiful flowers in one of the seasons (I forgot which ;;-;;), and a pond on the slope.
When it snowed, it was beautiful.

# After School
Another core memory was after school. Once school ended, I would race against my friends to the bus stop. 
Everyday, we went to a friend's house for afterschool. 
There, we did homework, occasionally had art classes, and fooled around as kids. 
A distinct memory I have is us crowded around the sofa playing Mario Kart Wii and Wii Party.
