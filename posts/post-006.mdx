title: A Week in Paris

description: After studying abroad in London, I went on a little Paris trip
---

Before I knew it, 3 weeks in London had passed. I decided to do a day-by-day blog/notes of my time in Paris.
This post won't be too coherent, but more of a diary for me to look back on.

<br></br>

On Friday, I went to the leaving party. 
I felt a little melancholic because I would probably not see any of the friends I had made for a long time as we all live far apart.

<br></br>

I have never had a significant problem with procrastination because everything usually turns out fine. I have to reconsider this.
For my flight to London, my father gave me a United Lounge Pass he got from somewhere. 
However, the pass he got was only eligible for a lounge that was at a different terminal.
Seeing I had time to spare, I walked to the other terminal and settled down, eating lunch. 

<br></br>

With little time to spare, I finished my lunch and ran towards the gate, which was much further than I had expected.
However, the gate was empty, so I worriedly asked around, thinking I had missed my flight.
After someone told me the gate might have changed, I ran up the escalator.
Full of adrenaline, my mind raced at a million thoughts per minute. I call it the clutch gene kicking in.
I checked the screen and realized that the gate had, in fact, changed.
I ran to the new gate and made it just in time as they were boarding for boarding group 3.

<br></br>

Anyways back to Paris. On Satuday, I had everything packed and was ready to go.
I took the Tube to St. Pancras Station and coincidentally saw my friends there. Turns out the day trip they were going to was at the same train station and similar time; what a small world.
Saying hi and bye again, I went through security and boarded the Eurostar.
On the Eurostar, I read *Heaven* by Meiko Kawakami and thoroughly enjoyed it. 

<br></br>

# Day One

Once I arrived, I pulled out trusty Google Maps and routed towards my hostel.
I did get a little lost in the train station and struggled getting a Metro ticket.
Thankfully, the information services could speak English and helped direct me my way.
Unlike London, you are unable to tap-to-pay with your contactless credit card.
Instead, you must use a Navigo pass or buy a physical ticket at a machine.

<br></br>

I checked into my hostel, **The People Paris Marais**, and was getting used to the locks.
The hostel was of high quality, providing a large safe as well as a smaller one next to your bed. 
I struggled with my room card because it wouldn't lock my safe; in the end, I had to have the front desk re-encode it 3-4 times before it finally worked.
I also met two of my roomates, who were from Sweden. Unfortunately, they were quite antisocial.

<br></br>

After settling in, I walked around the 3rd and 4th arrondissement. I found a really high quality leather jacket for cheap at a secondhand store.
Afterwards, I walked to the Notre Dame and discovered it was still under contruction from the fires in 2019.

</div>

When I returned to my hostel, I met my last roomate: Jerry from South Korea.
Unlike the two girls, he was receptive, and we chatted about things to do in Paris as well as our backgrounds and lives.

<br></br>

# Day two

My hostel had breakfast. In an effort to meet new people, I striked up a conversation with another solo traveller.
After breakfast, I resolved to buy plastic shower shoes because my current shower shoes had fabric which means it doesn't dry well and leaves a faint smell.
However, most places hadn't open yet as Parisians tend to start their mornings late. Thus, I was just strolling around and found a nearby park, Place des Vosges.
Surpringly, it was a rather well-known place and held a bit of historical significance. I was also surprised by the amount of people walking their dogs in the area.

<div className='flex justify-center'>

    <img src="/paris/hostel-shower.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

After realizing Muji was closed on Sunday, I bummed around the park, researching local shops selling shower shoes.
Then, it started sprinkling but I hadn't brought my umbrella. I ended up walking around the area, taking refuge in random shops.
While walking around, I found a Uniqlo; it's odd how I always end up in a Uniqlo within the first few days of arriving to a new place.
Anyways, I did some window shopping and found a nice map. I later got a falafel for lunch, recommended by one of the many guides I found online, but it started sprinkling again.
After more window shopping and walking around the area, I found another thrift shop and bought some nice Dockers pants.

    <img src="/paris/random-scenic.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

Afterwards, I decided to go to the Louvre in the afternoon, per Jerry's suggestion, so I didn't wait long in the line.
I'm been desensitized to museums because of all the ones in London so I kind of sped run the Louvre.
Sure, the art is interesting, but there's just so much well-done art that they each overshadow each other.
Most notably is the Mona Lisa, which even had an enormous line wrapping around just for pictures. 
I think I was a little hungry or hangsty, but I was a disappointed that everyone seemed to be snapping a picture then leaving.
It felt as though they spent more time looking at the picture on their phone, rather than the actual art piece. They're not *looking*.

<br></br>

After walking for god knows how many steps, I went to a restaurant and had beef tartare which tasted quite good.
The waiter was also really friendly and even warned me that tartare was raw beef. I wish I had tipped, but I was confused with the payment system and just paid the meal with my credit card on their scanner.

    <img src="/paris/tartare.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

After dinner, I headed towards Montparnasse, but I had time to spare. I ended up walking the 2 miles there, saving 2 euros from the Metro.
While walking, I realized that Paris was still a city before a place for vacation: I walked past armed guards on the street and was even cat-called with racist remarks.

<br></br>

During my trek I stopped by a McDonald's for a bathroom break.
The bathroom there was all-gender, so I was flustered when I opened the door to see 3 females staring at me.

<br></br>

Montparnasse is the tallest building in Paris; you can book tickets to see Paris from the 51st floor. 
I didn't think it was that great, but I'm still glad I went; I'm also deathly afriad of heights.

    <img src="/paris/montparnasse-eiffel.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

Once again, my phone was on 2%, so I snapped a few photos and memorized the route home.
After returning, I walked in on Jerry working out and decided to join him. That was all in one day;
I'm really living 3 lives at once.

<br></br>

# Day Three

It was excruciatingly hot that night, and we had no AC. Plus, with the privacy curtains there was little air-flow.
I was lying on my bed with nothing on and sweating truck loads of sweat. It eventually cooled down around 3 am.

<br></br>

The next day I went to Rue Cler, a nice paved market street, but arrived too early. I ended up just walking through the unopen shops to the Eiffel Tower.
There, I drank pineapple juice that I saw a local buy at a Franprix (grocery store) and enjoyed the scenery.

<br></br>

It was a nice day and wasn't too crowded.
I had planned to ask a stranger to take pictures of me with the Eiffel Tower.
I saw one person who seemed quite good but was too nervous to ask before he left.
Mustering up my courage, I ended up asking a mother-daughter duo and got some alright pictures.
It's off-centered, which is a little frustrating. Nothing I can do about it though.

<div className='flex justify-center'>
    <img src="/paris/eiffel.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>

    <img src="/paris/eiffel-closeup.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

I later walked across the bridge to the Trocadero Gardens, also under construction.
For lunch, I had beef stew which came with a Baguette. It was really good.
Afterwards, I joruneyed to a random nearby museum, the Guimet Museum of Asian Arts. 
Unfortunately, I kept sneezing and had been feeling a little sick because of the night before.
I cut my plans for another nearby museum and headed back to my hostel. 

<div className='flex justify-center'>
    <img src="/paris/beef-stew.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
    <img src="/paris/museum.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

When I arrived, the place was empty as my roomates moved out.
I was surpringly crushed because I would very likely never see them again, and we weren't close enough to exchange contact info.
It really got me thinking about what I want in the future and the importance of companionship.

<br></br>

With a renewed feeling and realization that time was passing fast, 
I started making bigger plans and iteneraries rather than going where I pleased.
At 8pm, I went to a classical concert at Sainte-Chapelle. 
[Frédéric Laroque](https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/artists/frederic-laroque) and his string ensemble 
played a variety of songs including
["Prelude and Allegro in the style of Pugnani"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBvjFhwCZAE),
["Pachelbel's Canon In D Major"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlprozGcs80), and 
["Vivaldi's Four Seasons"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxofEmo3HA&t=1470s). 
It's been a while since I last heard classical music, and it was pretty refreshing. 
The only downside was that it was really stuffy inside the chapel.

    <img src="/paris/rue-de-rivoli.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

Afterwards, I walked back on Rue de Rivoli, a nice street, and met my new roomates.
One was a professor from Greece who had taught in the States and Spain before Paris; one of my other roomate turned out to have an ex-boyfriend who attended the same high school as me, albeit like 10 years earlier.
The best part about hostels is variety of people you meet.

<br></br>

# Day Four 
I took a day trip to Vernon, Giverny.
Maybe it's because the signs are in French, but the train system in France is really confusing.
There are so many systems including Metro, RER, TER, and TGV, and I almost got lost boarding my train;
I am thankful for the friendly strangers.

<br></br>

The train passed by the more rural areas of France, and it was nice seeing the little houses with personalities. I reread parts of *Heaven* on the train again.

<br></br>
After getting off the train in Vernon, I boarded a little bus/train to Giverny. It was a well-designed system because most travelers went to Vernon for Giverny, but the train did run out of seats for the unlucky few.

<br></br>
Giverny was breathtaking, in part due to the weather. There was an enormous flower/sunflower? field, and Monet's Gardens are a must-see.

<div className='flex justify-center'>
    <img src="/paris/giverny-sunflowers.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
    <img src="/paris/giverny-h.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

I arrived back during rush hour but wasn't fazed at all. I was like a local Parisian at the Metro, getting my ticket and walking confidently and quickly to my destination.
I was a little hungry so I had some chicken gratin and gelato for dessert. I then checked out Shakespeare and Company, a bookshop, and bought *No Longer Human* by Osamu Dazai.

<br></br>

Afterwards, I had to do my laundry and pack for my second hostel.
I had planned to go clubbing or relax in a jazz bar, but I didn't have the time. There's always next time.

<br></br>

# Day Five
I checked out of my hostel and bought "Blue Period", a manga, for my friend who likes the series and knows a bit of French. I was surprised to see how popular manga was in France, especially how there were webtoon advertisements in the Metro stations.

<br></br>

As I made my was to my second hostel, **The Three Ducks Boutique** I was a little early as check in wasn't until 2pm.
I just spent the time exploring the area and having a very solid lasagna and dessert.

<div className='flex justify-center'>
    <img src="/paris/lasagna.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
    <img src="/paris/dessert.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

Story time. At 2pm, I picked up my luggage from the storage room and "person A" picked up his behind me. I checked in, and went to my room.
I unlocked the door, and person A was behind me, coincidentally in the same room. I laughed at the coincidence and held the door open for him. 
After dropping off my stuff, I headed to the Champ Elysées/Arc de Triomphe area. I also stopped by a Galleries de Lafayette, a shopping mall an upperclassmen recommended.
Unfortunately, it wasn't as impressive as the one in Haussmann, but it's always interesting to see architecture.
Then, a thought crossed my mind: person A never opened the door with his key card and could have been any random stranger. 
After debating for a while, I decided it was 1) unlikely he would steal my stuff as he seemed like an honest man and
2) if he wanted to, he could have already stolen my stuff and left by now, so there's no point in rushing back.

<br></br>

Thankfully, he was actually my hostel roomate, and my stuff was still there.
For dinner, I finally had escargot and duck confit before attending another classical concert, a candlelight concert, but it was still bright outside.
Here, Adrien Polycarpe played a variety of notable songs from Chopin, Schubert, Satie, Debussy, and Beethoven.
Afterwards, I wanted to see if I could make the sunset cruise. I e-biked along the river, and it was refreshing feeling the wind against my face. I made the cruise in the last few moments: I was one of the last to board.

<div className='flex justify-center'>
    <img src="/paris/escargot.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
    <img src="/paris/duck-confit.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

The sunset cruise was an experience I don't regeret but also not a big fan of. 
It was full of tourists on their phones, agian, but the view of Paris at night was very scenic, especially the Eiffel Tower.

A bit about that hostel: it was jank. It was 6 beds in a small room and no privacy curtains.
There were no bed bugs, but the mattress was a little damp.
The bed creaked if you turned to your side, and there was a gap between the bed and the window; multiple things of mine fell down that gap that night.
I don't quite remember, but I'm pretty sure one of my blankets and pillow fell through the gap. My bunkmate below handed them back to me through the gap, like an elevator lift. Looking back, it was quite funny because I hadn't even met this person (I slept before she came back).

# Day 6

I took the train, reading *No Longer Human*, to Versaille and arrived earlier than the check in time on my ticket.
Because I was early, I headed in the gardens and had brunch there.
I enjoyed the gardens because it wasn't too crowded and I generally enjoy nature.
Then, I went to the palace of Versaille at 12:30pm. Once again, I exeperienced yet another large building with too many art pieces.
What's worse was that Versaille was crowded and it was stuffy. 

<div className='flex justify-center'>

    <img src="/paris/versailles.jpg" alt="alt" className='w-1/4 rounded-lg mx-4 my-4'></img>
</div>

After heading back to Paris, I had dinner at a nice little cafe. I ordered grenouille (frog legs) and creme brulee.
I had yet to find a gift for my father's birthday (it was his birthday the day after I got back).
I was looking for something related to mice or rats because we recently had some rats in our cross-basin.
I ended up buying a nice picture of remy looking at the Eiffel Tower along a pop-up along the Seine River.

<br></br>

Bastille Day, the 14th of July, is similar to the US Fourth of July.
A unique aspect of the 14th of July is the Fireman's Ball: Firemen open their barracks and serve champagne/beer to the public.
I flew back the morning of the 14th of July, so I couldn't participate in the festival. However, the Fireman's Ball is also held the night before, so I happily attended that.
I invited one of my hostelmates, Diego, to the Fireman's Ball. We got a beer and enjoyed the night~

It was quite an experience as a good chunk of the music was in a foreign language. There were still songs in English such as "Macarana" and "Apple Bottom Jeans".
I even got sprayed by their hose while in the front...

# Day 7

I got up at 5:30 am to check out and take the Roissy bus to the airport.

<br></br>

and that's that!
