# Prologue: Summer Prior
When I got in to UCLA, I was ecstatic yet felt a bit undeserving.

Summer after senior year, I spent most of my time with my high school friends as we were parting ways.
I wanted to try all sorts of things beyond the bubble of high school:
from food to activities around the Bay.
Experiencing new things is a lifelong motto of mine--the world is so vast and human life is so short
(fun fact: I keep a list of things I want to do on my phone)

I came in excited, ready to take on the world.
I looked forward to meeting all sorts of people and experiencing all sorts of things in a foreign area.

> There's limitless possibilities in the unknown

# Fall
I sought to be active for freshman and school events.
Notably, the Enormous Activity Fair (EAF) was both interesting and overwhelming.
Hundreds of clubs sprawled across Wilson Plaza and the Dixon Courts was a lot to take in.

In the end, I hadn't really signed up for any clubs.
Later, noticing this I tried to be more proactive for the sports clubs.

The Club Sports had booths around Drake Stadium, which I found a bit more managable and interesting.
Coming from a background of swim and water polo, I wanted to do another water sport.
I was split between sailing, rowing, and dragonboat.

I think I missed sailing and rowing's tryout times but made it to Dragonboat.
I didn't really like the people or sport but it was interesting enough for me to stick around 
(see [Physical Activity](https://fred-site.vercel.app/blog/post-003)).

Besides Dragonboat, I also joined ACM and took part in their AI committee's projects track.
Over the course of the quarter, we would meet up weekly and work on an neural-network-related project. 
The people in charge were interesting and did well in explaining concepts
but I felt a lack of personal connection among everyone.
Although I did make a friend there, I felt there was a lot more potential;
I'm pretty sure the leads did not know most of our names.

Excluding dragonboat, I think I really struggled with finding a place to belong in the fall.

# Winter

Over the course of fall, I developed an interest in dance and found 
Foundations: a beginner dance club that accepted everyone who applied (first come first serve).
Although it was too late in the fall, I still checked out their auditions and determined to join Winter quarter. 
In winter quarter, I did so.

My classes had a very low time commitment so I invested a lot of time into dance.
Foundations had practice 7-11 pm twice a week, and occasional socials.
As a beginner with no prior experience, I also went to quite a few of the directors' optional office hours. 

One thing I was especially glad to experience was Wintensive: famous choreographers were invited to teach workshops at UCLA.
I couldn't go to Nick Joseph's due to a time conflict but I did go to [Anthony Lee's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oGTOMn9dxE&list=PL5idqdb0RICnYaTFyU6oRW8QDDwXceMgI) and that was really fun. 
I actually got to be right in front of him for a while by coincidence! It really changed my perspective of the intricacies in dance. 

I can say with confidence that I've gotten more comfortable with my body, although there is still a ways to go.
I intend to join Foundations again (and hopefully againx2 as a captain!), during a quarter where my class load is a bit lighter.

# Spring

Tired of getting a haircut for my slightly overgrown hair every quarter,
I decided to switch it up and bring back the buzz.

I had actually planned to join the Game Music Ensemble (GME) in Winter
but didn't have the time for it.
I tried again in Spring: I brought my tenor sax mouthpiece and planned to borrow a tenor from the music department.
However, a music major had damaged their tenor and priority went to him as it was for his major.
Unfortunately, I didn't get to join the club but did attend their concert and even saw 
AverageJonas sing ["GunsForHire"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxH3pR095Sw) and "Warriors" live.
It was pretty insane, and I could have even played with him!!

Coming to LA, I did have plans to go to at least 1 concert.
Lo and behold, I went to my first two concerts in Spring!
RADWIMPS' first NA tour was on 4/18 and
TWICE's Ready to Be World Tour on 6/10 (2 days before my finals, haha).

RADWIMPS was really crazy because my friends and I actually watched *Suzume* THE DAY BEFORE!
A surprising thing is that RADWIMPS is a rock band;
besides a few of their songs (Makoto Shinkai's movies), their discography is full of rock music.
They even had an insane back-and-forth rock battle between two members of the band.
I didn't lose my voice, but definitely burnt a lot of calories from jumping around.

TWICE was really nice as well.
At SoFi Stadium, right across from RADWIMPS at YouTube Theater,
seats were filled to the brim. 
It was exciting to be in such a packed stadium.

While waiting for the concert to start, a nice person in front of us offered some photocards which we accepted.
I loved listening to their songs and the concert had more interaction that I expected.
I was happy to see a lot of their individual characteristics/personalities through their conversations.
We got to see each member's special solo stage and Jihyo's was a teaser to her solo debut (which just came out: "Killing me Good")!
They performed so many of my favorite songs, including less popular ones like "Doughnut" and "Cry for Me"!

Speaking of celebrities, so many showed up around our school.
Westwood is this small commercial neighborhood and has a theatre which often shows premiers.
A lot of famous people end up coming: for exmaple, Kevin Hart came for "Me Time"'s premiere.
Others also come for various reasons: Stephen Curry came for the Warriors and Kings game.
I hope to see more celebrities around!

The rest of spring quarter was pretty much me grinding for a notorious CS class.
The TA's and professor were out of sync.
For example, we learned the contents of the first homework an entire week after it was due.
Throughout the quarter, I was stumbling around trying to play catch up.
It's frustrating having a rather straightforward concept be presented so confusingly.
Despite that, I did gain a lot out of it; I guess growth comes from pain.

# Epilogue: To Sophomore Year
This year, I have a few plans (again). I plan to join GME(for real this time) and try out new sports.
I was thinking of fencing, or a form of mma.
For ACM Design, I had participated in helping a Nonprofit redesign their website which was quite fun.
Unfortunately, the people invested in the club dwindled down throughout the quarter,
Though we didn't end on a poor note, there was potential for more.
That's why I want to join a smaller CS club focused on these kinds of projects where everyone is as invested as you.

For ACM, I ended up getting some kind of Dev Director officer role (mainly because no one wanted it)
and I plan to make some workshops/project tracks in the fall.
One of my goals, inspired by Matthew Wang, is to make it accessible and welcome to those with "no experience required",
as ACM is that kind of club in comparison to competitive/smaller based clubs.
