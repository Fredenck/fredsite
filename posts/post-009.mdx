# Prologue
Coming into my second year at UCLA, I had a lot planned.
After experiencing an entire year here, I've begun to adapt to life as a college student.

I'm getting used to taking care of myself and maintaining a desirable work/study-life balance.

This year I live in Gardenia. Though more secluded, I really enjoy the area. 
Despite being next to frat row, the airtight windows muffle noise and it's never too loud to sleep.

Walking to my dorm is also unique.
I can choose to either walk through De Neve Plaza and up Gayley or straight up De Neve Drive.
The first route has less incline (about 3 flights of stairs) and the second route has more people (pretty much everyone on the hill).
I have the luxury to choose based on how I feel at the particular moment.

### Goals

Last year, I was so caught up with Dragonboat that I ended up a lot and a little.
I want to leave college with little regrets (words taken from a good friend) and was determined to try new things by taking a lighter courseload.

The top of the list are sports. Sports are special because it requires a team aspect which is difficult to achieve after college.

I knew that I would not be able to handle all the things I wanted to try on top of Dragon Boat so I took a year off.
Despite that, I'm still around; I go to some events and try to get to know the new members.
I really miss spending time with the team even if we were waking up at 5 in the morning but the loss motivates me to make the most of my time away from DB.
Dedicated, I thoroughly checked out EAF and made a list from sailing to boxing and brazilian jiu-jitsu of potential things to join.

Ultimately, I settled on fencing: boxing's practice times were weird and sailing didn't have enough space for their welcome regetta;
plus, I knew a guy in fencing. Besides that, I also joined a friend's IM volleyball team!

### BP/Nova
I also applied to Blueprint and Nova because I think they do really cool stuff and seem like a community I would want to be apart of.
I was pretty confident in my application and was looking forward to getting in. Funnily enough, I didn't even get an interview.

It was really disappointing because someone I admire is apart of Blueprint but it's his last year here.
I first met him as my CS35L LA. He was the best; he explained everything with so much clarity and was so genuine. 
Genuine, kind, patient: those attributes really align with my core values and
I believe that approaching things with good intent is a good way to live.

### ACM
After ending up as Dev Director for ACM Design,
I really thought about what makes a club good.
In my freshman year, Design was enjoyable and had great people in it;
however, there was a lack of commitment and disconnect in the club.
I had heard great things from the past Design committee and wondered what made it so great.
Curious, I started looking in old documents ranging from meeting minutes, journals, and events.
It was a bit disheartening seeing the club become less and less active after covid.

I really wanted to build a culture and form a community. A club is made of its people; a club is its people.
Great people make a great club and a great club makes great people.
There's always really talented people that stand out but once they graduate or leave, things tend to stagnate.
It was then that I decided that I wanted to do something great-and have the future do something greater.
I want to leave a legacy and make something good that lasts.

Over the summer, I scoured around and came up with a track for those with no experience to get into UI/UX Development with React. 
Teaching was really rough.
As a college club, attendance is like exponential decay: there's simply other things that people care about.
That, and catering towards people of different experience was really tough.
Despite being beginner focused, there's still varying levels of beginners which is exacerbated by programming's steep learning curve.

> Nobody is a bad programmer

Computer Science is a wonderful subject and I believe that programming is a valuable skill even if you don't intend to pursue CS.
Programming teaches a methodologic thought process. It's a different way of thinking, which can be really difficult to get the hang of.
Yet, no one is inherently bad at programming because it's just another way of expressing logic.

By the end of the quarter, there were still a few who consistently showed up and I'm super thankful for that!

### BSA
Without BP/Nova, I had one less commitment which opened another door.
I joined Bruin Sports Analytics, as a Tennis Consultant.
The team collaborates with UCLA D1 Mens/Womens Tennis by analyzing collegiate match data.

The lead, invited us to watch one of our players play at Pepperdine at the beginning of the quarter.
Surprisingly (or maybe not), I was the only member who went so it was just me and him.
I enjoyed it though. I tend to enjoy smaller groups and really got to know him.
Plus, it was nice being in a new area and learning about D1 tennis.

### Fencing and IM VB
Interested in a new sport, I tried out fencing.
It's pretty interesting learning the form and footwork and I think it's especially good for me with my weak hips.
Practice consist of drills and fencing on the strips.
I would say I enjoy the club but I do feel a bit disconeccted with the team.
I think I end up usually focusing on the sport itself rather than socializing.
I'm kind of indifferent towards other conversations but I think I'll try to be more friendly next quarter.

Around the same time, I also had my first IM Volleyball match.
I didn't know the team well and didn't get to know them well which is one thing I do regret.

Every week we kind of just showed up, played the game, then went on our separate ways.
I don't think I had a conversation with one of the teammates until the third game, haha.

I did get closer with one of my teammates by pestering him on ways to get better.
Another dude, I really liked but didn't talk to much turned out to be graduating that quarter.
I was crushed because it's I'll probably never see him again so I really wish I got to know him more.
I guess I just thought, "oh we'll just run it back next year," except that there is no next year with him.

A recurring thing to me is that college is really about the people you meet.
Sure, it's about education but you can get fantastic education online, free of charge.
In university, you meet people of all kinds of backgrounds with all kinds of talents.
Congregating this in one place as a melting pot during the formative years of college is probably one of the best ideas ever.

College is also special in that you meet a lot of people and make a lot of fleeting connections.
These can be extremely strong or weak as people have no obligation to you.
There's nothing wrong with either kind of relationship.

I actually really enjoy volleyball.
Playing in IMs, I had a lot of game time and our team "clicked" at certain moments.
It was really exhilarating to enter the flow state.
I also realized that I really love team sports.
In contrast to swim or dragonboat, sports like water polo or volleyball can have all sorts of strategies and plays that utilize everyone's strengths.

With the desire to improve, I looked towards open gym. Though a bit clique-y, everyone is friendly.
I guess I can be socially awkward or something because I would typically sit on the side by myself when waiting to play.
I think one of the driving factors is that I didn't have a desire to make new friends and rather have it occur naturally through playing time.
By the end of the quarter, I did get to know a few cool people there and hope to get to know them more in the future!

### Dance
Speaking of cliques, I feel like the dance community is a bit like that.
Maybe not a clique in a sense, but kind of closed off. 

Missing dance from my time at Foundations, I decided to go to a workshop by someone who had a hand in choreographing one of my team's pieces.
I usually go with an old teammate but he was out of town so I treaded there alone.

It was interesting hearing the choreographer's perspective on dance and what it means to him.
I really loved the creativity in expanding the wave to something more.
On the flip side, I felt quite lonely being there by myself and out of place.

### GME
Another area I was interested in getting back into was music. 
I started playing in middle school but couldn't in high school (dropped marching band for water polo).
I was in 0-period jazz band though.

Music is something I enjoy playing but also hard to be self-motivated for.
GME seemed cool because it combined video games and music (we played game soundtracks);
they were pretty sick during their Spring benefit concert with AverageJonas singing!

I couldn't make the Jazz group because of class so I opted for orchestra, a larger ensemble.
I definitely enjoyed being in that environment again but also felt that I wasting my time.
Having taken private lessons and performed in small groups often, I really prefer smaller groups/combos where I can push myself.

In the end, I returned the Tenor I borrowed from UCLA (thank you Mr. Gilberti!).
A part of me still wants to play, to groove with others and even improvise solos, but time is limited.
At least for this year, I've decided not to take this commitment. Maybe next year though!
A friend of mine is playing keyboard in a small band and another friend has a group where they played at Prince of Venice!
Maybe a small band next year wouldn't be bad at all.

### Leisure and Fin: Fin-als and Fin-ish
I had a pretty good amount of fun this quarter outside of school!
As an avid fan of good food and new experiences, I have a huge collection of "things to do" in my Notes app.
I'm actually considering adding a separate Food Blog based part to my personal side of my website (check out GitHub Issue #10)!

I went to Sawtelle a few times for food, Dockweiler Beach for a bonfire, 
Westfield for Ramen Nagi, KBBQ and Bossom/Kalgaksu in Ktown, the Munch Cafe and 3Thyme, 
Friendsgiving and post-friendsgiving OC at Long Beach, The Broad and the Getty, 
saw Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse with a live orchestra with Daniel Pemberton in the Hollywood Pantages Theater,
the Grove for Christmas Lights and more!

Despite all that, I felt quite drained by the end of the quarter. I was just *tired*.
It's weird saying this at 19, but I feel my age catching up to me.

My classes weren't difficult as I was only taking 3 (+ a fiat lux). 
Every day, I had one class except Friday where I would have 4 (all 3 + Discussion).
Regarding finals, I wasn't really stressed as I got 90s on my midterms; I definitely have less regard for my grades after freshman year.
Funny tangent: I was studying outside and a squirrel jumped on my table and robbed my cookie.
However, it was still in its plastic wrapping so the squirrel couldn't bite through it.
It accidentally dropped out so I unwrapped the plastic for it as a good deed.

I wanted to come back home just cuz.
I ended up not going to a ski trip with Dragonboat depsite wanting to snowboard again but I think it was for the best.
These few days at home have been really therapeutic: I've started to learn how to cook and plan on spending more time with my parents as they are getting old.
Time really flies by; college is going by really fast.
