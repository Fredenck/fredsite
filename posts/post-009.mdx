# Prologue
Coming into my second year at UCLA, I had a lot planned.
After experiencing an entire year here, I've begun to adapt to life as a college student; I kind of know "what's up".
I know how to dedicate time to a task and maintain a desirable work/study-life balance.

# Fall
This year I lived in Gardenia. A bit more secluded, I really enjoy this dorm. It's a deluxe so we have a larger room and AC.
Though it's next to frat row, the airtight windows really muffles their noise and it's never too loud to sleep.
Walking to my dorm is also special. I can either walk through De Neve plaza and up Gayley to minimize incline or go through De Neve Drive as everyone else does. 

I planned to take lighter classes Fall quarter and spend some time exploring new things.
Last year, I was so caught up with Dragonboat that I inadvertantly ended up a lot and a little.
I want to leave college with little regrets (words taken from a good friend).

This year I wanted to try new sports. I took a hiatus on Dragonboat but am still around; I showed up for tryouts and a kbbq social.
I already knew that I would really miss the team this year but that also acts as motivation for me to go crazy on all the things I'm doing without Dragonboat as a commitment. 
Dedicated, I made a list of sports at EAF from sailing to boxing and brazilian jiu-jitsu.

Ultimately, I settled on fencing: boxing club practice times were not ideal and sailing didn't have enough space for their welcome regetta.
Plus, I previously knew a guy in fencing. Besides that, I also joined a friend's IM volleyball team!

## BP/Nova
I also applied to Blueprint and Nova because I think it's really valuable to help nonprofits with the unique skills us students have. 
I was pretty confident in my application responses and was really looking forward to getting in. Funny thing is that I didn't even make it past the first round.

It was really disappointing because someone I really admire, Jerry Xu, is in Blueprint but it's his last year here.
I first met him as my CS35L LA. After the first discussion, I knew he was the best; he explained everything with so much clarity and was so genuine. 
Genuine, kind, friendly: those attributes really align with my core persona. I always try to approach everything with good intent.

## ACM
After attaining the position of Dev Director for ACM Design, I really thought about what makes a club good.
In my freshman year, ACM Design was enjoyable and had great people in it; however, there was definitely a lack of commitment and disconnect in the club.
I had heard great things from the past and wondered how and why it was so great.
Curious, I started looking in old ACM documents ranging from meeting minutes, journals, events, etc.
It was really disheartening seeing the jouranls of the past presidents as the club slowly became more inactive.

I really wanted to build a culture and form a community. A club is made of its people; a club is its people.
Great people make a great club and a great club makes great people. I saw instances of multiple legendary people in ACM but once they left, little remained.
It was then that I decided that I wanted to do something great-and have the future do something greater. I want to leave a legacy and make something good that lasts.

Over the summer, I scoured around and came up with a track for those with no experience to get into UI/UX Development with React. 
Teaching was really rough. As a college club, you always have huge amounts of people show up for the first meeting and much less for every meeting after that.
That, and catering towards people of different experience was really tough.
Even though it's beginner focused, there are still beginners with varying levels of experience.
Plus, programming has such a large learning curve. 

> Nobody is a bad programmer

> -- <cite>Matt Wang</cite>

Computer Science is a wonderful subject and I believe that programming is a valuable skill even if you don't intend to pursue CS.
Programming teaches a methodologic thought process and no one is inherently bad at programming because it's just a methodology to express logic.
Paradigms from Greedy, Divide and Conquer, and even Dynamic Programming are **natural** ways humans act and think; it's just expressed in a specific way for a computer to understand.

I could count the number of people who showed up with my fingers by the end of the quarter.
I am incredibly thankful to you guys for showing up and pulling through!!

## BSA
Without BP/Nova, I had one less planned commitment which opened another door.
I joined Bruin Sports Analytics, as a Tennis Consultant.
The Tennis team collaborates with UCLA D1 Mens + Womens Tennis teams by taking collegiate match data and analzying it.

The person in charge, also named Jerry, invited us to watch one of our players play at Pepperdine. Being free, I naturally tagged along. 
Surprisingly (or maybe not), I was the only member who wanted to go so it was just me and Jerry.
Through that, I really got to know him and it was really fun watching college D1 tennis and Pepperdine was really beautiful. 

## IM VB
Around the same time, I also had my first IM Volleyball match.
The team was assembled by people the captain knew so I didn't know a few people at all.
I think one thing I regret is not being more forthcoming and open to my teammates.

Every week we kind of just showed up, played the game, then went on our separate ways.
It was probably not until the third game when I actually talked to one of my teammates, haha.

College is really special in that you meet a lot of people and make a lot of fleeting connections.
These can be really strong or extremely weak as people have no obligation to you. There's nothing wrong with either kind of relationship.

I actually really love volleyball. Playing in IMs, I had a lot of game time and our team "clicked" at certain moments.
It was really exhilarating to enter the flow state and you feel invincible.
I also realized that I really love team sports where you can run all sorts of interesting plays. 
In contrast to swim or dragonboat, sports like water polo or volleyball can have all sorts of strategies and plays that utilize everyone's strengths.

I also got to know one of my teammates much more because I would always ask for tips to improve.
Another dude, I really liked but didn't talk to much, actually turned out to be graduating that quarter.
I was quite crushed because it's pretty likely I'll never see him again and I really wish I got to know him more.
I had always kind of thought, "oh we'll just run it back next year," except that there is no next year for him :'(.

A recurring thing to me is that college is really about the people you meet. Sure, it's about education but you can get fantastic education online, free of charge.
In university, you meet people of all kinds of backgrounds and have all kinds of talents.
Congregating this melting pot in one place during the formative years of college is probably one of the best ideas ever lol.

I also ended up going to open gym VB a lot. It was a little clique-y there but everyone was generally friendly.
I would typically just sit on the side by myself when waiting to play.
Near the end of the quarter, I did make some friends and when I go to open gym in the future, I hope to get to know them more and maybe not sit by myself like a recluse, oops.

## Dance
Speaking of cliques (wow I'm suddenly reminded of the max-clique NP-complete problem), I feel like the dance community is a bit like that.
Maybe not a clique in a sense, but kind of closed off. 

Missing dance from my time at Foundations last year, I decided to go to a workshop by Josh Baisa, who had helped choreograph one of my Foundations team's choreographies. 
I usually go with one of my old teammates but he was out of town at the time so I treaded there alone. 

It was interesting hearing Baisa's perspective on dance and what it means to him during his workshop.
I really loved his creativity in applying the concept of waves beyond the standard definition and learned a lot!
On the flip side, I felt quite lonely being there by myself and felt out of place as a lot of dancers are really extravagent and confident.

## GME
Another area I was interested in getting back into was music. 
I started playing in middle school but couldn't in high school (dropped marching band for water polo).
I did however join 0-period jazz band.

Music is something I enjoy playing but also hard to be self-motivated for.
GME seemed cool because it combined video games and music (we played game soundtracks);
they were pretty sick during their Spring benefit concert (see freshman year post).

I couldn't make the Jazz group because of classes so I attended the orchestra section (Orchestra is a much larger ensemble). 
I definitely enjoyed being in that kind of environmeny again but also felt like I was wasting my time.
Having taken private lessons as a kid and performed in small groups often, I really prefer smaller groups/combos where I can push myself.

In the end, I returned the Tenor I borrowed from UCLA (thank you Mr. Gilberti!).
A part of me still wants to play, to groove with others and even improvise solos, but time is limited.
At least for this year, I've decided not to take this commitment. Maybe next year though!
One of my friends was in a small band playing keyboard but they're on hiatus.
Another friend had a group going as well. Maybe a small band next year wouldn't be bad at all.

## Fin: Fin-als and Fin-ish

I had a pretty good amount of fun this quarter outside of school!
As an avid fan of good food and new experiences, I have a huge collection of "things to do" in my Notes app.
I'm actually considering adding a separate Food Blog based part to my personal side of my website (check out GitHub Issue #10)!

Despite all that, I felt quite drained by the end of the quarter. I was just *tired*.

My classes weren't difficult as I was only taking 3 (+ a fiat lux). 
Every day, I had one class except Friday where I would have 4 (all 3 + Discussion).
Regarding finals, I wasn't really stressed as I got 90s on my midterms; I definitely have less regard for my grades after freshman year.

I wanted to come back home just cuz.
I ended up not going to a ski trip with Dragonboat depsite wanting to snowboard again but I think it was for the best.
These few days at home have been really therapeutic: I've started to learn how to cook and plan on spending more time with my parents as they are getting old.
Time really flies by; I can't believe I'm 33% of the way through college if I deicde to drag out graduation to 4 years.
Check out my next post for more thoughts!
