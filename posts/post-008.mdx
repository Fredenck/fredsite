# LSE
Last year, my gym buddy brought up the topic of studying abroad for the summer. 
The concept was novel to me; I had never thought I could do such a thing.
Thus, I started looking into programs. 
I had always wanted to go to Europe and studying abroad there would be perfect especially considering the lack of a language barrier!

Looking for a university in central London, I ended up going to London School of Economics (LSE) for a computational financial math course.
The program only lasting 3 weeks, I sought to make the most of it. 
I'm pretty sure I was out exploring every day.

## Sidney Webb
When my application got approved for LSE, I hadn't realized that I could start booking dorms.
By the time I did start booking dorms, I realized that there was only one dorm left (oops): Sidney Webb. 
A little disappointed I hadn't started earlier (and get one of the more popular dorms) but also thankful I got housing, I had mixed feelings.

South of River Thames, my dorm was the furthest from campus.
Despite that, public transportation came in handy:
wherever you are in London, there's always a bus or Underground station (Tube) close by. 

Sidney Webb really grew on me.
Some of my favorite things were the ambience, Tokoton Ramen, and Morley's Fried Chicken.
- Because my days were so hectic with going around new places in the city, it was always therapeutic coming back to a more calm suburban area.
- I discovered Tokoton a bit later but the food and shop decor were simply splendid.
- Morley man. Right across the street in bright red. 
Cheap, fast, and gobsmackingly delicious, I came here if I wanted to treat myself.
One of my favorite memories is coming back after a long day to get Morley's with my floormate, Roger.
I love this man so much. We would also occasionally offer each other snacks/groceries since we shared a fridge!
I remember him texting me he had extra peaches for me and I was so touched by that.

I first met him on the day I arrived. Quick story interlude!

### The First Day

I have never had a significant problem with procrastination because everything usually turns out fine. I have to reconsider this.
For my flight to London, my father gave me a United Lounge Pass he got from somewhere. 
However, the pass he got was only eligible for a lounge that was at a different terminal.
Seeing I had time to spare, I walked to the other terminal and settled down, eating lunch (provided by United).

I finished my lunch and started walking towards the other terminal.
However, I realized it was mcuh further than I had expected so I started to run.
After reaching the gate, I realized it was empty and the screen showed boarding to Canada.
Something was wrong. I initially thought I missed my flight but was doubtful that they moved up departure time.
Asking around, an attendent told me the gate might have changed so I ran up the escalator to check the screen.
Full of adrenaline, my mind raced at a million thoughts per minute. I felt the clutch gene kicking in.
I checked the screen and realized that the gate had, in fact, changed.
I ran to the new gate and made it just in time as they were boarding for the last boarding group.
I can't believe I almost missed my international flight to London just because I was dilly-dallying and enjoying my lunch.

I calmed my nerves and watched a few movies on the flight. 

> Fun fact: I don't often watch movies.
> They're usually too long for me to get started and I prefer other forms of entertainment. 
> Despite that, I've resolved to watch more movies this year.
> Whiplash, La La Land, and the Social Network are at the top of my list right now.

Arriving at Heathrow (airport), I took the Piccadilly line for about an hour to central London.
I actually got off a stop or two early at London Bridge because I thought to take a stroll through the city.
That was not the best choice because I had to carry my luggage with me which was super tiring.

Finally reaching Sidney Webb, I found out I wasn't allowed to check in until afternoon because they were still cleaning.
Leaving my luggage with them, I went to check in at the school and walked around the area (Covent Garden).

Coming back, I talked to these two guys, Roger and Connor.
They were from the same university in China and we got along really well.
Later I discovered that Roger was my floormate and Connor lived in the same house!
Fun fact Roger's name came from Captain America and Connor came from Assasins Creed, loll.

Dorms in the UK are unique because they're mostly singles. 
Sidney Webb consisted of ~6 houses/buildings, each with 5 floors and 6 people per floor.
Each floor/flat had a shared kitchen area and 6 rooms.

Ok back to my friends at Sidney Webb. 

Besides Roger and Connor, I also met Weigh from Singapore. 
At first, we would take the bus together to class but I usually woke up a bit later so they would go first.

Things I really enjoyed included Bad Moon Cafe: a cafe with board games,
watching the Phantom of The Opera, eating Morley's together, 
and going around places like the National Gallery and the Natural History Museum.

## Daily Life

Life in London was such a unique experience. Each morning, I would wake up and take one of the red double-decker buses to LSE.
Those buses are goated. Public transportation is actually amazing over there.
There, breakfast was covered through my housing: hashbrowns, eggs, baked beans (sweet...), sausage, toast.
It definitely took a while to get used to, but it kind of grew on me during my last week.

</div>

After breakfast, I would head to class at the Aldwych Clement house.
Class was 3 whole hours, every single day! Luckily we had breaks in between; plus, I made lots of fantastic friends in class :)

After class we would typically get lunch together and head to discussion where our group would be a bit split up. 

After that we were free! I loved going around Covent Garden and just reveling in the scenery.
One of the highlights of London is definitely the walkable city.
It's really beautiful there: there's unique architecture and so many parks. The Tube is amazing as well!

</div>

Coming back to my dorm was a simple process: 
if I were going back from LSE, I'd just take the bus (rarely);
anywhere else, I would take an Underground (Tube) line and transfer (if needed) to Northern line (usually Southbound).

# Museums and Parks!
Museums and parks are definitely a highlight of London.

I'd say the National Gallery is one of my favorite museums of all time.
I really liked the style of art there compared to other museums such as the British Museum or Tate Modern.

# Classmates
I think this is the main group of friends I spent time with!
I remember walking in class on the first day wanting to sit somewhere near the front and next to people who seemed cool.
Luckily there was a spot and I'm so happy that I chose to sit there. 

I sat on the leftmost end of the second center row. 
On my right, there was this girl called Amy and on my left there was 
... nothing ... cause I was on the leftmost end lol.
I think she had been talking to the girl on the right of her before I came in. 
Anways, I introduced myself to them and turns out Amy studied at Princeton and Jean (two seats right) at Hong Kong.

I think us, and some people sitting in the row behind decided to get lunch together.
That was kind of the start of a friend group. 

It was so fun going to all sorts of places with this amazing group of people.
Portobello Road Market, the Boat Party, Brighton! (amazing fish and chips), Borough Market, Volleyball, and so much more;
I'm so glad I got to experience these things with wonderful indviduals: Amy, Deep, Jermaine, Luq, Isabel, and more!

It's so eye-opening to see all kinds of people from different backgrounds and experiences.
There's just too much to transcribe everything here:
Amy's happy-go-lucky cheerfulness, Deep's goofyness, Jermaine's hilarious jokes
(I can't remember the specific joke was but it was so funny no matter how many times you said it),
Luq's style and witty humour, and Isabel's smile and presence. 

I'm so lucky to have met this group of people; I would not have it any other way.
I can't wait to visit you or you to visit me in the future!

Special shout out to Jean.
We were the only ones in the friend group in our particular discussion section so we ended up spending a lot of time together.
I actually had a small crush on her but wouldn't have wanted to pursue relationship.
Anyways we did a lot together and it was super fun which was the best scenario!
From paddleboating on the Serpentine in Hyde Park to checking out Greenwich and Covent Garden,
I really enjoyed having the companionship experiencing new things. 

## Soho with Alex, Oxford + Regent's Park with Muthu!
I actually knew two people from UCLA coming to LSE: Alex and Muthu. 

With Alex, I texted him where I was in Soho but he found a similar but different place to my description a block down.
I didn't have good data as it was a bit underground and we probably spent 30 minutes trying to find each other.
After that, we walked all around Soho and checked out shops like Selfridge. 
Then we got food; it's always a treat to sit down and eat good food after walking all day.

With Muthu, the main thing we did was check out Oxford and Regent's Park. 
Not only is the city of London's public transportation extremely convenient, trains are superb as well.
A quick and simple process, we got on a train at Paddington station 
(sidenote: I saw Hogwart's 9 3/4ths station at King's Cross!) and soon arrived.

Oxford is so different. All the buildings are ancient with nice architecture and grass.
Not a huge Harry Potter fan, I tagged along Muthu where she brought me to the notable locations such as the cloisters and Draco Malfoy tree.

Being big fans of Bruno Major, we had to check out Regent's Park.
We even got some little water color pieces by a local artist.
I absolutely love going around the parks in London; there's so much greenery!

After that, we also checked out Daunt Books, which I bought *Heaven* by Mieko Kawakami and read on the Eurostar to Paris!
I also got the renowned tote bag for my mom.

On a side note, weather in London is just alright.
It's a little humid for me as I grew up in the Bay Area.

I tried to cover most of what I remember of my trip to London.
I knew that 3 weeks would go by in a flash so I tried to do something every day. 
It still did go by in a flash though.
